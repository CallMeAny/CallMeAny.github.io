Florence  Nightingale (1820-1910) is known for her service as manager and training  of nurses during the Crimean War,  and for her writings and use of  simple graphics explaining her medical ideas. She professionalized  nursing roles for women and founded the first secular nursing school in  the world. As a girl she had decided that she wanted to dedicate her  life to helping others, but had to fight against the anger of her family  die to the expectations of her becoming a wife and mother. When news of  the horrific conditions in which the wounded of the Crimean war were  being treated reached England, Florence moved there with the volunteer  nurses that she had trained, and some nuns. They found overworked  medical staff, lack of medicine, and neglected hygiene, resulting often  in mass deadly infections. She realized that the extremely poor living  conditions were causing the spread of diseases, and brought up  suggestions like washing hands, flushing the sewers, improving  ventilation. The death toll among wounded soldiers fell from 42% to 2%,  and her ideas were implemented in the designs of new hospitals. She was  nicknamed "The Lady with the Lamp", due to her angelic presence visiting  the wards at night.‚Å†

Comandanta  Ramona (1959-2006) was a Zapatista revolutionary who became a symbol of  equality and dignity for indigenous and impoverished women. Her activism  started when a new trade agreement allowed foreign companies to  increase their presence in Mexico. Indigenous people saw their culture  being threatened and the lands that gave them subsistence being  overstressed. Women, until then ignored by politics as a irrelevant  minority, took action: Ramona helped write the Revolutionary Women's  Law, helping emancipating women from the antiquated cultural and sexist  norms. The influence of leaders like Ramona became so significant that  the Zapatista Army of National Liberation ended up being composed by one  third of female personnel.‚Å†

Violette  Szabo (1921-1945) was a British/French Special Operations Executive  during WWII. She grew up as a very athletic girl, often deemed tomboyish  especially after her father taught her to shoot and she discovered she  was very accurate. When war reached Britain, Violette was bored of her  daily life, so she enlisted in the Auxiliary Territorial Service and was  sent as a predictor on anti-aircraft batteries. She had married a  French soldier, who was killed in action: this made Violette accept an  offer to train as field agent, her best way to fight the enemy who  privated her from her husband. She was trained in multiple fields, from  navigation to weaponry, to demolition to communication and cryptography,  and she was enlisted in the Field Aid Nursing Yeomanry, an all-women  charity active in both nursing and intelligence work. Her first mission  had her travel to occupied parts of France to assess how compromised an  intelligence circuit already deployed was by German arrests. On her  second mission she was supposed to coordinate local maquis (French  guerrilla soldiers) in sabotaging communications while Germans tried to  stem the Normandy landings. However she was dispatched to join them with  a car, that civilians were forbidden to use. This rose German  suspicion, and she was arrested at a roadblock, after putting up a  gunfight: she was sent to a detention camp, and eventually executed  there.‚Å†

Naomi  Campbell (1970-) was discovered as a model at age 15. She never met her  father, who abandoned her mother while she was pregnant, and took the  Campbell surname from her stepfather. From age 3 Naomi had studied  dance, and first appeared in a music video at age 7, for a Bob Marely's  song. She intended to pursuit a career as a dancer, but got scouted  instead and her modelling career quickly took off: she appeared on the  cover of British Elle before her 16th birthday. She faced some racial  discrimination, and through her entire career never earned as much as  her white colleagues. Nevertheless, she received support from the other  models: if Naomi couldn't get the jobs, the other girls wouldn't accept  the job either. She was the first black model on the cover of multiple  editions of Vogue. In the 90s she was declared "the reigning megamodel  of them all", and for her and a handful or her colleagues the term  "supermodel" came into use. At the end of the supermodel era, while  still appearing on the catwalk, Naomi pursued other ventures, for  example music, cosmetics and acting. She is active in multiple  charities, and has spoken against discrimination and for social  integration and inclusion multiple times.‚Å†

Buffalo Calf  Road Woman (~1844-1879) was a Northern Cheyenne woman who became a  legend by turning around the retreat of the Cheyennes during the Battle  of the Rosebud: the warriors were fleeing the battle, leaving Chief  Comes in Sight wounded on the ground. When Buffalo Calf Road Woman saw  him she turned around and rode full speed to him, grabbing him and  bringing him to safety. Upon seeing this, the warriors raised again,  ending up in defeating General Crook and his forces. In her honor, the  Cheyennes call this battle "The Fight Where the Girl Saved Her Brother".  She also participated on the Battle of Little Bighorn, and after 100  years of silence the Cheyenne storytellers decided to share their  stories, speaking of how it was Buffalo Calf Road Woman who knocked  Custer off his horse before he died.‚Å†

Elfriede  Jelinek (1946-) is a playwright and novelist, who won the Nobel Prize in  Literature for her works mixing multiple voices to show the absurdity  and at the same time the power of clich√©s in society, often focusing on  the battle of sexes and on female sexuality. Her mother planned for  Elfriede to be a musical talent, tutoring her in multiple instruments.  She graduated from the Vienna Conservatory and later studied art history  at university, but had to quit due to an anxiety disorder, that led her  to self-isolate for a year. That's when she started writing, as a form  of therapy. However, she later said that writing was for her always a  struggle and she had to battle great inner resistance, but she went  through out of a sense of social obligation. When her work gained her  the Nobel, she wondered if the main reason of receiving the prize was  that she was a woman. She didn't show up for receiving the prize in  person, instead sent a video message and revealed how she suffers from  social phobia.‚Å†

Nettie  Stevens (1861-1912) is the geneticist that discovered sex chromosomes.  Nettie could get a good education thanks to her father, whose  carpentering job earned him enough to send her and her sister to high  school. Nettie always excelled, and continued her studies obtaining an  MA in biology. She became interested in histology, which is the study of  the microscopic anatomy of biological tissues, and went on to get a Phd  in cytology. Shortly after the rediscovery of Mendel's genetics theory,  she observed that male mealworms produced two kinds of sperm. When an  egg was fertilized with the sperm with large chromosome, it produced  female offspring; egg fertilized with small chromosome sperm produced  male offspring. This allowed to discover the cause of sex-discrimination  during reproduction.‚Å†

Meryl Streep  (1949-) is often described as the best actress of her generation. She  grew up being encouraged by her mother to follow her dreams, to put her  mind to something and not be lazy in pursuing it. As early as 12 Meryl  realized she enjoyed performing in front of a camera, and got opera  lessons for singing at a school recital. However she realized that she  wasn't feeling that art, so she didn't pursue the singing career. During  a representation at college she gained attention across the entire  campus for her natural way of acting, and for the ease with which she  could mimic accents and pick up her lines. The pic was taken when she  was leading home after being refused a part in King Kong because she was  too "ugly". Her answer to that critique was '[...] you're just one  opinion in a sea of thousands and I'm off to find a kinder tide.' She  went on to be nominated for a record 21 Academy Awards winning 3, and a  record 32 Golden Globe nominations and winning 8.‚Å†

So she changed school, and became  the first African American to receive a Doctor of Juridical Science  degree from Yale. She wrote the book "States' Laws on Race and Color",  which was soon seen as the bible of the civil rights movement. For her  entire life she struggled with issues regarding her own sexual identity,  holding relationships with women and being nowadays recognized as  transgender.

aya Lin  (1959-) is a designer, architect and artist that works with sculptures  and land art. In the US she achieved national recognition when, at age  21, her project got chosen for the Vietnamese Veterans Memorial. Maya  grew up in rural Ohio, and from there comes the attention to  environmental issues that she puts in her work: what she tries to do is  to find balance in the landscape, respecting nature rather than trying  to dominate it. The Memorial she designed represents an opening or a  wound in the earth, where the wall with the names of the fallen could be  seen as the scar covering it: the design was picked in a "blind"  competition, and it sparked a lot of backslash. Some of the critiques  were to the Memorial itself, being deemed of a too dark color and only  honoring the fallen and not all the combatants; some critique targeted  directly Maya because of her Chinese heritage. In the end, an additional  statue has been added to the Memorial, whose original design didn't  change, to try to appease the malcontent. Nowadays, the same memorial  also serves for veterans of Afghanistan and Iraq.‚Å†

Baroness  Bertha von Suttner (1843-1914) grew up in an eccentric family: her  mother and aunt considered themselves clairvoyant, and therefore  periodically took up gambling hoping in increasing their fortune. This  resulted multiple times in financial disaster, forcing the family to  move in smaller properties. This, added to the fact that Bertha's  ancestry wasn't of pure aristocracy, kept her away from Austrian court.  However, Bertha still got an excellent education: in times of hardship,  she took up writing as a supporting career, becoming also a journalist.  She wrote pacifist pieces, of which the novel Die Waffen nieder! (Lay  Down Your Arms!) was particularly successful. Her pacifism was based on  the idea that peace is a natural state, and so the right to peace could  be demanded under international law and was necessary in the context of  an evolutionary Darwinist conception of history. Moreover, she brought  forward ideas like women being equal to men, and showing how sexism  affects both men and women. Thanks to her work, in 1905 she became the  first woman to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.‚Å†

Anna  Wintour (1949-) showed her strong fashion sense at an early age, when  in school she began rebelling against strict dress codes by taking up  the hemlines of her skirts. Already at age 14 she started wearing her  hair in a bob, style that nowadays is iconic especially when  complemented with dark sunglasses. She cultivated her interests in  fashion with magazines, among which Seventeen that her grandmothers sent  her from the US. Anna's father, editor of the Evening Standard, started  consulting her for ideas on how to increase the young readers of the  newspaper. She started working as editorial assistant in fashion  journalism, but due to disagreements with colleagues, she moved to New  York: working again in fashion magazines, she got fired after nine  months due to her innovative shoots that the editor didn't appreciate.  She took time without working, but kept up her photo shoots, and finally  they become appreciated when she became the fashion editor of New York.  She pretty much discovered how effective was in sales putting a  celebrity on the cover of a magazine, and the editor at the time was  willing to bend rules to let her work spread out. In 1985 she got her  first editorship of Vogue, in the UK: she reorganized the magazine,  earning her fame as a difficult and demanding boss, but her aim was to  target "a new kind of woman out there, she's interested in business and  money. She doesn't have time to shop anymore. She wants to know what and  why and where and how."‚Å†

National  Coalition of American Nuns (NCAN, founded in 1969) represents about 2000  Catholic nuns who promotes "diverse feminist, faith-filled voices". As  early as 1972, NCAN promoted the idea that women should be fully  welcomed into the church, including the priesthood. They published a  5-year plan to achieve gender equality within and outside the church,  advocating for reformation of the economic and power system. They fully  supported 2018 Women's Marches around the world, and condemned the  "vulgar words" used by president Trump. In contrast with the official  catholic church position, NCAN advocates for reproductive justice,  meaning the right of a woman to choose what is best for herself,  including using contraceptives and having access to abortion. NCAN  members volunteered to escort women through protests outside of abortion  clinics. Fighting the image that nuns are strict and repressive, NCAN  also supports the LGBT community and its acceptance into the church. Due  to these liberal positions, NCAN has caused controversy among other  christian people and within the Vatican itself.‚Å†

Boudicca was  the queen of a British Celtic tribe who led an uprising against the  occupying forces of the Roman Empire. Boudicca's territory was  recognized as an independent ally of Rome, but when her husband the king  died his properties were sized and his reign annexed, and she and her  daughters were abused. Enraged Boudicca led a revolt: she destroyed  modern Colchester, and left Verulanium and modern London burning. The  Romans didn't have enough men to face the revolt, and had to evacuate  Londinium. This crisis almost convinced Emperor Nero to completely  abandon Britain, and only a fortunate victory of outnumbered Roman  forces allowed him to regain control. It is said that Boudicca might  have poisoned herself after the failure, and she is considered a British  folk hero.‚Å†

Lalla Fadhma  N'Soumer (~1830-~1863) was part of the Algerian resistance during the  first years of the French colonial invasion of Algeria. Lalla Fadhma  always had a strong character, proved for example by her insistence in  following the lessons in her dad's Koranic school, which was highly  unusual for girls. She was married very young, but refuses the role of  wife and mother and went back to her religious studies, leading an  ascetic life. Soon pilgrims started visiting her, believing she could  communicate with saints and foresee the future. When the French were  besieging her city, Lalla Fadhma started convincing the men to take a  stand and go to war. She take part to the battles too, providing food to  the fighters and tending at the injured. For a few years the actual  command of the resistance was of Bou Baghla, said to be a lieutenant of  the defeated Emir, but upon his death the armed forces moved under the  command of Lalla Fadhma, assisted by her brothers. After a desperate  resistance against the much bigger and stronger French army, Lalla  Fadhma was taken prisoner and held in a camp, in which she died of  infection years later. Lalla is an honorific title, reserved for women  of high rank or who are venerated as saints: from a European point of  view, she was the Joanne d'Arc of Algeria.‚Å†

General Amaya  (fictional, The Dragon Prince) is one of the highest-ranking generals  in the army of Katolis. She is deaf and communicates through sing  language, translated by her lieutenant for the ones who don't know ASL.  She is a skilled lip reader, and her deafness is no problem when leading  her soldiers in battle and fighting for her homeland. As fierce as she  is as a warrior, she is also caring and loving, and especially to her  nephews who are trying to prevent a diplomatic incident from escalating  into a war. The representation of disabilities is not common at all in  cartoons: General Amaya (together with Toph from The Last Airbender) is  one of the first characters fully developed and not portrayed only  through her disability.‚Å†

In 1849 she escaped to Philiadelphia, where she  embarked on her courageous mission by returning to Maryland to rescue  her family. She then started guiding dozens of other slaves to freedom  by working in secrecy at night. Nicknamed Moses she became the first  woman to lead an armed expedition (guiding the raid of the Combahee  ferry) which liberated over 700 people who were enslaved.

Chanel Contos  is an Australian sexual assault survivor and an activist. She created  the Teach Us Consent petition with an aim was to get insight into the  number of sexual assaults at private schools and demand a change in New  South Wales. To her surprise, the petition was signed by more than  25,000 people whereas the sexual assault testimonies were more than  4,000. 1,500 of them have been reviewed. Her initial plan was to see the  principals of private higher schools, use the testimonies to alarm them  and push for earlier and compulsory consent education in schools.  However, the action has gained monumentem and in March 2021, Chanel  worked together with Stacey Maloney to enable sex assault survivors to  report the crime without launching an investigation and launched Project  Vest. The idea is to empower victims to get a closure which might be  crucial in their healing without the danger of revictimization that the  reporting and contact with the police might pose. There will be no  consequences for the perpetrators unless they reoffend. The strength of  Chanel and of all others who fight against sexual violence is an  inspiration to all of us.√¢ÔøΩ¬†

Emmy Noether  (1882-1935) is often described as the most important woman in the  history of mathematics. As a young girl she did not stand out  academically, but she was quick in solving brain teasers, showing a  great logical intelligence. As all girls, she was taught to cook and  clean, but those were not her passions. At first, she wanted to teach  French and English, but instead studied mathematics. When she was  invited to join the mathematics department at the University of  G√∂ttingen, a really famous center of research, the philosophical faculty  objected because she was a woman, and she had to spend years lecturing  under another professor's name. During her time, she developed theories  that became fundamentals in abstract algebra and theoretical physics.‚Å†

Maria  Goeppert Mayer (1906-1972) wrote her doctoral thesis on how atoms can  absorb photons to move to a higher energy state. At the time, there was  no way to experimentally verifying her hypothesis, but nowadays with the  laser that has been proved and the theory brings her name. From Germany  she moved to the US and got jobs at many different Universities, and  during WWII took part in the Manhattan project. She is mostly known for  developing a model for the structure of nuclear shells, work for which  she was awarded the Nobel Prized shared with two colleagues. Nowadays,  an award with her name is given out to women that reach astounding  results in physics in their early careers.‚Å†

Beulah Louise  Henry (1887-1973) was given the nickname of Lady Edison for her many  inventions: in 1937 she was known as America's leading feminine  inventor, and in her career she received 49 patents for a total of 110  inventions. She was a creative and curious child, and used to look at  things and point out what was wrong with them, and how she would have  changed them. Her first patent was at age 25, for a vacuum ice cream  freezer. She then moved to New York, founding two companies and serving  as consultant for all other companies manufacturing her work: in the big  city she lived in hotels, belonged to many scientific societies and,  surprising for the time, never married. Her inventions cover many  categories, but tend to focus on improving women's quality of life (she  invented an hair curler, a bobbinless sewing machine,  a snap-on parasol  to match patterns with the owner's dress,...) and toys (she came up  with a method to inflate dolls instead of stuffing them).‚Å†

Emily Greene  Balch (1867-1961) was a feminist and pacifist: she was always interested  in socioeconomical issues, and when teaching in Wellesley College she  focused on immigration, consumption and the economic roles of women. She  was a leader of the Women's Trade Union League, and served in the first  commission on minimum wages for women. When the US entered WWI, she  opposed conscription in espionage legislation, and supported the civil  liberties of conscientious objectors. She was religious, and her thought  was that American economy was "far from being in harmony with the  principles of Jesus which we profess." She became a leader of the  international peace movement, and played a central role in what became  the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. In 1946 she won  the Nobel Peace Prize for her work with the League.‚Å†

Hertha Ayrton  (1854-1923) was a British inventor, engineer and suffragette. She had  to start caring for her siblings when still really young, as her father  died and her mom was left pregnant and taking care of her and her six  siblings. She got an education thanks to her aunt who run a school. She  was working as governess, but also studied in Cambridge, where she was  involved in multiple activities: she built a sphygmomanometer, led the  choral society and formed a mathematical club, and founded the Girton  fire brigade. At Cambridge she didn't get a degree because at the time  only certificates were handed out to women, but she later got a Bachelor  of Science at University of London. During all her life she went on  studying and at the same time funding herself with jobs like teaching  and embroidering, while caring for her disabled sister. She patented  multiple inventions, but her most known work is about the electrical  arc: she was the first woman admitted at the Institution of Electrical  Engineers, and she was to read her work in front of the Royal Society  but wasn't allowed due to her sex (a man read it in her stand). However,  just a few years later, she was the first woman to be awarded the  Hughes Medal from the Society itself. It is thanks to her success that  the British Association for the Advancement of Science started to allow  women to serve on committees.‚Å†

Isabel  Allende (1942-) is a Chilean writer, known for mixing myth and realism  in her novels, often taking inspiration from personal experiences and  historical events. She used to work as Spanish translator for English  works, but she was fired after altering dialogues to make the female  characters sound more intelligent. Due to a political coup that  threatened her life, she was forced to flee to Venezuela, and that  allowed her to flourish, away from a patriarchal setting that would have  expected her to be an obedient family woman. Although her writings  attracted some negative criticism, being described as commercial rather  than literary relevant, she was also described as "literary legend", in  an article that named her the third most influential Latino leader in  the world.‚Å†

Joan  Beauchamp Procter (1897-1931) was always influenced by the family  interest in arts and science. Although chronically affected by health  problems, she could pursuit her curiosity in natural history in the big  gardens of her home. She had a special lover for amphibians and  reptiles, often keeping snakes and lizards as pets, and at some point  even a crocodile. Although her health prevented her from having an  active lifestyle, she kept correspondence with many researchers in the  field, and affirmed herself as an expert with works on animals like the  Komodo dragon. She worked on taxonomies, and made innovative  contributions to veterinary practice and zoo displays.‚Å†

She joined Walt Disney in a research tour of  South America, and her watercolors impressed Walt so much that he  appointed her art supervisor for two animated films. She worked on color  styling for big movies like Cinderella, Alice in Wonderland and Peter  Pan, where her concepts and ideas have a strong influence on the end  result. She then worked as freelancer, until Walt asked her to put her  talent and innate color styling into developing pavilions for the New  York World Fair in 1964.

Alice B.  Clement (1878-1926) was called the female Sherlock Holmes of Chicago,  where she was a renowned detective. In fact, she was so famous that she  had a series in a newspaper and starred in her own movie, titled ‚ÄúDregs  of the City‚Äù. Not only was she the first female detective in Chicago,  but very likely in all of the Unites States. She first joined the  Chicago Police patrolling department stores in search of pickpockets,  becoming detective in 1913, at the age of 35: she was known to enter  crime scenes with gowns and beautiful hair-do, and being unapologetic of  her lifestyle. She was loved by the media but not so much among the  police force, however she and successive female PDs were so successful  that their superior resigned. ‚Å†
One of Alice's most famous case even  inspired Agata Christie "The Dulcimer" story, involving a murdered young  woman: the woman was most likely a prostitute ill of typhoid, and  Alice's male colleagues assumed she had just succumbed to her  "lifestyle". Alice wasn't convinced of this, and further investigations  revealed that the woman had acquired typhoid as part of a murder plot.‚Å†
Alice  didn't spend all of her time on crime scenes: she also walked the city  streets, helping in car accidents or rescuing runaways and destitute  girls, while campaigning for women‚Äôs voting rights, the repeal of  prohibition and the right of divorce.‚Å†
Her success grew more and  more, until tension within the police force resulted in her being  demoted and forced to take a medical leave, when the diabetes that she  had managed to hide up until that point led to her death.‚Å†

Zenobia  (240-274 AD) was a queen of the Palmyrene Empire in ancient Syria. She  was most probably of Aramean and Arab ancestry. When she was about 14  years old, she was married to Odaenathus, the ruler of the city and of  the Roman territories from Black sea to Palestine. Zenobia became a  queen after her husband's death, and it is possible that she was  involved in his assassination due to her political ambitions. To ensure a  smooth transition of power, for a period she continued the politics of  her husband, and fostered an intellectual environment open to scholars  and philosophers, as well as protecting religious minorities. But then,  in 270 AD, Zenobia launched an invasion which brought most of the Roman  East under her control, culminating with the annexation of Egypt. She  declared her son emperor, and assumed the title of empress for herself.  The Romans had to sustain heavy battles before regaining control of the  region: she was captured only after a siege to her capital, and was sent  in exile to Rome for the rest of her life.‚Å†

Joan  Semmel (1932-) is a feminist painter, known for large scale self  portraits made from her own perspective, so usually looking down on her  naked body, using luminous colors. She spent years developing her style  in Spain, but it was upon her return in New York that she was shocked by  the amount of sexualization of women in magazines sold at newsstands.  That's when she started painting in a figurative style and incorporated  the erotic aspects that made her famous. During a panel on about  painting and the legacy of feminism, she stated that "If there aren‚Äôt  great celebrated women artists, that's because we have not been  celebrating them, but not because they are not there."‚Å†

Juana Gal√°n  (1787-1812) rose to fame during the Peninsular War, when Napoleonic  forces wanted to take control of Spain and Portugal. She lived in  Valdepe√±as and knew how to collect information by keeping her hears open  while working at the tavern at the entrance of the village. When  Napoleon's troops attacked the village and not enough men were available  to defend it, she encouraged women to take the fight: she is depicted  smashing the soldiers that crossed her path with a baton or even with a  cast-iron pan, while other women poured hot water and boiling oil on the  roads. Their efforts helped the decisions of the French army to abandon  the region, and the town was given the title of "very heroic".‚Å†

Tawakkol  Karman (1979-) grew up near Taiz, in Yemen, and in a family of lawyers  and journalists she graduated in commerce and in political science.  Tawakkol became internationally known in 2011 as the public face of the  Yemeni uprising during the Arab Spring, and she was called the Iron  Woman and the Mother of the Revolution. In the same year she was one of  the recipient of the Nobel Prize for Peace thanks to her non violent  struggle for safety of women and women participation in peace-building  work. In her country she had been advocating for press freedom since  2005, which evolved in weekly protests in 2007: she is the co-founder of  the human rights group Women Journalists Without Chains, and has seen  her requests to legally create a newspaper and a radio station rejected  by the government, and the discontinuation of a SMS news service that  belonged to the group.‚Å†
She advocated for female rights, bringing  attention to Yemeni girls getting denied food in favor of boys, high  female illiteracy rates, and child marriages. On national television she  swapped the traditional full-covering niqab in favor of more a colorful  hijab showing her face: her point is that full coverage is cultural and  not dictated by Islam.‚Å†

Yeshe  Tsogyal (~8th century) is considered the mother of Tibetan Buddhism.  She was born a princess and fled from arranged marriages: she wanted to  pursue a life of spiritual practice rather than being a wife. She was  married to the emperor of Tibet, who gave her as an offering to an  Indian Buddhist master who he had invited to propagate Buddhist  teachings. The master freed Yeshe, and she became her main disciple and  consort. She wondered if the female body was inferior, and her master  advised her that the male or female body is the basis for enlightenment,  and a woman's body striving for enlightenment is the better one. Yeshe  is an important role model, and through many years of spiritual  practices she reached awakening. She is seen as a fully enlightened  Buddha.‚Å†

Petra Herrera  (1887-1916) took part in the Mexican Revolution by joining the forces  of General Francisco Villa disguised as a man. With the name of Pedro  Herrera she could keep her disguise for quite some time, using tricks  like pretending to shave her face every morning as to avoid questions  about facial hair. She was an excellent leader, and reached the rank of  captain leading a brigade of 200 men. She even had some victories, but  after revealing her real identity Villa refused to give her military  credit and didn't permit her to serve as a general. Therefore, Petra  left Villa's forces and formed her own all-female brigade, in which she  commanded over 1000 women. She is unofficially credited with the take of  the city of Torreon, but this didn't prevent her army to be dissolved  by superior orders. Petra became a spy, working in a canteen in the  state of Chihuahua: her actions become a bit foggy here, but reports  agree that she got shot by a group of drunken bandits, and although she  survived the attack she later died of infected wounds.‚Å†

Calafia  (fictional) was the queen of the island of California, in an epic novel  of chivalry written around 1510. The pagan queen ruled over a queendom  of black women, all trained as warriors. Calafia, who wanted to achieve  great things and see the world, was in command of a fleet of ships that  she obtained as tribute from the surrounding lands, and her territory  was defended by an army of griffins trained to see any man they found.  She joined Muslims trying to retake Constantinople from the Christians,  although she had no concept of either one of the religions. However her  griffins start to attack her allies, as they can only distinguish  between man and woman, not between Muslim and Christians. Moreover, the  golden armors that Calafia's warriors are wearing are too soft to  protect against arrows. Calafia decides to face the enemy princes in  single combat to decide who wins the battle. She falls in love with one  of these princes, and converts to Christianity to marry him and go back  to California to start a new Christian dynasty complete of men and  women.‚Å†
When this story was written, America had just been discovered  by the European, and legends of a land of gold or a land ruled by  warrior women was what led onward Spanish explorers. The details of the  story reinforce the vision of Christianity as the one true religion, but  most importantly highlights how Africans were seen as culturally  advanced by Europeans in the 15th century, and the importance of black  people in the exploration of the new continent.‚Å†

Kate  Shelley (1863-1912) is recognized as a US railroad heroine, and is the  first woman to have a bridge and even a train named after her. Her story  started on a heavy thunderstorm night, which caused a flash flood which  in turn washed out some of the timbers supporting the railroad bridge. A  locomotive was sent to investigate the damages to the line, but the  bridge couldn't support it and it plummeted into the creek with its crew  inside. Kate heard the crash, and went out investigating knowing well  that there was a passenger's train due to come only a few hours later.  She found two of the crewmembers still living, and went to search for  help. Her lantern went soon out, and she had to crawl across the  leftovers of the bridge with just lightnings to show her way. She run  two miles before finding a depot where she could run the alarm, and then  led a rescue party back to the incident. Thanks to her action, two of  the crewmembers were saved, and the passenger's train with 200 on board  was stopped in time.‚Å†

Helen Sharman  (1963-) is the first British astronaut and the first woman to visit the  Mir space station. She applied to the Project Juno program after  hearing a radio advertisement looking for the first British space  explorer, and was selected among almost 13000 other applicants. She  spent 18 months in intensive training in Star City in Russia, and even  though the Project Juno was almost cancelled due to financial issues,  her project could advance under Soviet expense. She went into space aged  27 years and 11 months, and stayed there for 8 days: she worked at  medical and agricultural tests, photographed the British Isles and took  part in an amateur radio hookup with British schoolchildren. She never  had the opportunity to return to space, although twice she made it into  the lists of ESA as a possible applicant.‚Å†

Sarraounnia  (XIX century) is an African hero, seen a symbol of Pan-Africanism. Her  name is in fact a title, meaning "queen": in a period where most of the  African populations surrendered without fight against the invading  French, Sarraounnia led her Aznas community in battle against the  colonial troupes. One of the reports of the battle that she sustained  says the she was the one starting hostilities, by sending a message  saying that she was going to block the road to the French soldiers with  her invincible warriors. The tribe couldn't stand long in battle, and  the French could quickly move on, but not without leaving deaths and  injured on the ground. The Aznas took refuge in the forest, and came  back to their village as soon as the French left.‚Å†

Empress  Theodora (~500-548) became a Eastern Roman empress upon his husband  Justinian accession. At a young age she served in a brothel serving  low-status customers, and later became a dancer and actress there. She  traveled to North Africa as concubine, and after being abandoned she met  Justinian while dancing at the hippodrome races. At the time it was  illegal to marry outside of rank, so Justinian changed the law so that  he could make Theodora his wife. She was given the imperial seal,  meaning that her consent was needed before any decision had legal  validity, and she was in charge of holding court on her own when the  emperor was unwell. She proved herself a worthy leader when during a  riot she advised the emperor against fleeing, with a determined speech  showing how it is better to die as a ruler rather than hiding in exile.  Justinian stayed, and restored order, albeit committing a massacre  against the rioters.‚Å†

Joan  Jett (1958-) is a rock star who was described as the Queen of Rock 'n'  Roll and the Godmother of Punk. When she was 14 she started playing  guitar, but soon quit taking lessons because her instructor insisted on  teaching her folk songs. Joan Jett & the Blackhearts is the band  that she founded in 1979: she placed an ad in the newspaper saying that  she was "looking for three good men", and so found her first bass  player, guitarist and drummer. While gaining fanbase, she invested  personal savings to print copies of their album, and started selling it  from the trunk of their cars. The album I Love Rock'n'Roll was the  turning point, and from there she moved on with other albums and  performances, breaking the record at the time for the fastest ticket  sell-out on Broadway.‚Å†

Belva Ann  Lockwood (1830-1917) realized she needed a higher education to support  herself and her daughter, when her husband died. She tried to apply at  Law school: on her first attempt, she was refused with the reason that  her gender might have distracted the men; on her second attempt, she was  admitted and passed all of her exams, but wasn't awarded the diploma  because she was a woman. Early in her life she discovered how she was  paid half of what her male counterparts gained, and her status of  married/widowed woman didn't help either: after finally managing to  practice her profession, she started lobbying in Congress for bills of  equal rights and anti discrimination. In 1879 she was sworn in as the  first woman of the U.S. Supreme Court bar. She run for presidency of the  US in 1884 and 1888, although with virtually no chance to win as women  had no right to vote and newspapers were opposing her openly.‚Å†

Aviva Rahmani  is a performance and conceptual artist. One of her early projects was a  collaboration for "Ablutions", a feminist performance about rape where  women bathed in eggs, blood and clay and where finally wrapped in a  sheet while a soundtrack of women telling the details of their rapes  played continuously. She then became an ecological artist, with pieces  that could be the restoration of landscapes to museum venues collecting  paintings, sounds and photographs. For her approach, she merges science  with aesthetics, for example with her work "Trigger Points, Tipping  Points" where she displays satellite imagery with warnings on the  changes induced by climate change on the global landscape. She manages  to put the topics of class, power and justice in the discussion about  climate change, which is not a usual approach. For her recent work, she  used the internet, to spare the pollution that would have come from  flying around.‚Å†

Brenda Milner  (1918-) is known as "the founder of neuropsychology". She was born in a  family of talented musicians, but she had no interest in music:  instead, her dad tutored her in mathematics, and that's what she started  to study in College. However, she decided that was not the field for  her, so she changed her field of study to psychology. As a graduate she  took interest in the human brain and in the study of brain lesions,  however after WWII her research was diverted in developing tests for  selecting aircrew, in particular she was tasked to create aptitude tests  to distinguish fighter pilots from bomber pilots. Brenda was a pioneer  in studying human memory and cognitive functions, and it was thanks to  one of her articles showing that temporal lobe damage can cause  emotional and intellectual changes in the patients that many  neurosurgeons stopped performing surgeries that could negatively impact  the patients lives. She hypothesized that there are different types of  learning and memories, each dependent on a separate system of the brain,  and could prove the existence of a couple of these memories. In 2017  she was still teaching, and exploring the interaction between the  brain's left and right hemispheres.‚Å†

Agnodice  (legend) is credited as the first female midwife or even obstetrician  (which requires more formal education in medicine) in ancient Athene.  Her story says that she practiced as physician disguised as a man,  because at the time medicine was a forbidden practice to women. She  tried to tend to women in labor who were ashamed to consult male  doctors, so her success among lady patients rose easily above that of  male doctors. These were jealous of her, and accused her of seducing her  patients. During her trial, Agnodice lifted her clothes, revealing that  she was a woman: her charges changed to breaking the law that forbid  ladies in medicine, and only thanks to the defense of wives of important  Athenians the law was changed. ‚Å†

Regine Jonas  (1902-1944) came from a strictly religious jew household in Berlin. As a  young woman, she intended to make a career as a teacher, but became  disillusioned with the idea and joined the Higher Institute for Jewish  Studies in which she took seminary courses: she was not the only woman  there, but was the only one with the goal of becoming a rabbi. She ended  her studies with a thesis centered around "Can a woman be a rabbi  according to Halachic sources", and her conclusion was that yes, she  could be ordained. Her thesis was accepted by the Talmud professor  responsible for ordinations, but his sudden death prevented him from  ordering her. As other women before her, Regine was given a role similar  to the one of a rabbi, but was not officially given the title: the fear  was that a female rabbi would cause massive internal problems and  clashes in the Jewis community. It took five years for a liberal rabbi  to notice her and ordain her, but the community wasn't welcoming and  Rebecca was turned away from Berlin's New Synagogue. When Nazi  persecution started, she stayed in Nazi Germany, continuing her teaching  and rabbinical work under harder and harder conditions, until the  Gestapo confiscated all her property and deported her to Theresienstadt.  There she continued her work, and helped building a crisis intervention  service by screening newcomers at the train station with a  questionnaire about suicide. She worked there for 2 years, writing at  least 23 sermons and organizing cultural events to distract others from  the grim events around them. In October 1944 she was deported to  Auschwitz and murdered there. Her life and work was never mentioned by  notable individuals who were at Theresienstadt, and only rediscovered in  1991 upon the opening of eastern Germany archives.‚Å†

Sigrid the  Haughty (legend) was the daughter of a powerful Swedish nobleman, and  held many great estates. Two kings sought to marry her, but she burned  them to death to discourage other suitors. Later the king of Norway  asked for her hand, but also asked her to convert to Christianity. She  said that the was not going to part from the faith of her family and  ancestors, answer that the king didn't like at all. He slapped her with a  glove, act that made Sigrid decide to work for his downfall. She allied  Sweden with Denmark, leading to the Battle of Swold, in which King Olaf  of Norway fell. These stories come from Norse sagas, and it is unclear  how much historical sources went into making these stories. Modern  interpretations assume that the life and acts of multiple women were  collected and merged to create the figure of powerful, revengeful  Sigrid.‚Å†

Pussy Riot  (founded in 2011) is a feminist punk rock and performance art in Russia.  They say anyone can join, and the group usually has between 10 and 20  members, who wear brightly colored balaclavas and use aliases when  giving interviews to preserve anonymity. They staged unauthorized  guerrilla performances in public, which were filmed and published online  as music videos. Topics covered feminism, LGBT rights, opposition to  president Vladimir Putin, his policies and his ties to the leadership of  the Russian Orthodox Church. Pussy Riot became world-famous when  members were arrested after an action outside Moscow's cathedral in  which they protested the church support for Putin in the election  campaign. The actions were depicted as sacrilegious, and three group  members were condemned to prison for hooliganism "motivated by religious  hatred". Pussy Riot target both western and Russian audiences, but  while the just mentioned case got a lot of attention in the west,  especially from human right groups, it was regarded with less sympathy  by Russian public opinion. Pussy Riot members continued staging  performances, for example during the Sochi Olympics, or with a pitch  invasion during the final match of 2018 FIFA world cup.‚Å†

Melba  Liston (1926-1999) got her first trombone when she was 7 years old. She  learned how to play it mostly by herself, with her grandfather teaching  her spirituals and folks songs. At age 8 she was already good enough to  perform a solo act in a local radio station. During her school years  she played in all-female bands, and in the 40s she started to play in  big bands and became the first woman trombonist to do so. At first she  performed as supporting voice, and only after a lot of encouragement she  started playing as a featured voice. She toured with big artists like  Billie Holiday, but soon left and dedicated herself to teaching because  she didn't like the road life and the indifference of the audience and  even of the producers to which she always had to prove herself. However,  she always spoke of support and camaraderie from the male musicians.  She turned her career to making arrangements for mid-sized and big  bands, and although not widely known by the most she is highly regarded  in the jazz community as a trailblazer.‚Å†

Sally Ride  (1951-2012) was the first American woman in space, and the third overall  after two USSR cosmonauts, and the first known lesbian person to do so.  She was selected to be an astronaut as part of NASA Astronaut Group 8,  the first class to select women. After graduating training, she served  as capsule communicator, and helped develop the Canadarm robot arm. She  took part in two missions on the Shuttle Challenger, and was completing  her training for a third flight when the Challenger disaster occurred.  Thanks to her experience, she was named into the commission  investigating the disaster, and later also the Columbia disaster. Having  never had female astronauts before, the engineers had to face some  unforeseen challenges: in preparation of her first mission, which was  planned to last one week, they asked her whether 100 tampons would be  enough. It seems the conversation went more or less like this: "Is 100  the right number?" "That would not be the right number" "We just want to  be safe." Poor engineers definitely needed a quick briefing on how  period works.‚Å†

Olympe  de Gouges (1748-1793) was a French playwright, political activist and  feminist active during the revolution. Born in southwest France, she  moved to Paris after her husband died: she started a relationship with a  wealthy man, but refused his marriage proposal defining marriage as  "the tomb of trust and love". She established a theater company and  attended philosophical and artistic salons. With her writings and plays  she took a stand against slavery, for which she became the target of  threats. Many moved against her and her success, and she ended up taking  legal action: she was determined to be successful, in spite of her  enemies. She greeted the revolution with hope, but quickly become  disenchanted when the equality was not extended to women. In response to  the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, she wrote the  Declaration of the Rights of Woman and of the Female Citizen, and a  Social Contract named after the work of Rousseau. She fought for the  right of women to gain active citizenship, and to express their opinions  and vote. She was against violent revolution and supported  constitutional monarchy, to the point of writing in defense of the king  and against capital punishment: this enraged many republicans and  deputes, and her writings becoming more strong got her arrested. It was  in fact against the law to publish anything that encouraged the  monarchy, and she was even writing a piece in which the queen tried to  save the monarchy. Even though in the piece there was Gouges herself  scolding the queen, she was judged for creating a character that could  inspire sympathies. She was denied a lawyer on the base that she could  defend herself, and she got sentenced to death for seditious behavior  and attempting to reinstate the monarchy.‚Å†

Claudette  Colvin (1939-) was arrested in Montgomery, Alabama, for refusing to give  up her seat to a white woman on a crowded segregated bus. While the bus  system was mostly used by black people, the rules were that if the  white part was full then people of color had to give up their seats to  go stand in the back. When this happened and Claudette refused to give  up her seat, she was thinking of the people who fought before her,  against all sorts of abuse, for example the fact that black people was  not allowed to use dressing rooms in stores and had to buy clothes based  on diagrams of their own measures.‚Å†
The bus incident involving  Claudette happened nine months before the more famous one that involved  Rosa Parks. While her case helped spark the bus boycott that led to the  end of bus segregation in Alabama, her case was not publicized by  Montgomery black leaders because, among other things like being a  teenager and not being fair-skinned, at the time she was pregnant with a  child out of wedlock: if the white press would have known this  information, they would have called her a bad girl and the case wouldn't  have had a chance. Rosa Parks was bound to be more accepted by the  white media as the public face of the movement, but Claudette was among  those who started it all. However, due to her actions, Claudette was  labeled as troublemaker from her own community, and as Rosa also did,  she had to move to another city because in Montgomery she couldn't find a  job and life was a struggle.‚Å†

Pope Joan (in  charge 855-857, legend) was a literate and talented English woman. She  used to dress up as a man, possibly to appease a request from her lover,  and she was so convincing that she managed to get initiated as monk.  From there, with her knowledge she was able to rise through the church  hierarchy and was eventually elected pope. However, she wasn't  practicing celibacy, and she ended up pregnant: possibly due to the  movements of the horse she was riding on, she went into labor in the  middle of the road during the Easter procession, and she gave birth  surrounded by all the fidels. Her story has different endings: some said  she died of labor, some say she got stoned by the enraged people, some  said she was hidden away by the church in a convent. It is said that the  Pope that came after her her put all of his effort in deleting every  trace of her existence, and that due to her disguising a new ritual  (that never actually existed) was put in place to ensure the Pope-to-be  was actually a man and not a woman or an eunuch.‚Å†

Eufrosina  Cruz (1979-) comes from Oaxaca, Mexico, from a tiny Zapotec village.  There the traditional customs are still very much alive, and women are  held to their role of submissive hard workers: they are expected to wake  up in the middle of the night to gather fuel, tend to the kids, clean  the house and prepare food, all while keeping silent and in the shadows  when men are around. Girls often can't attend school and are married off  at a young age to a men chosen by the father. At the age of 11,  Eufrosina decided she didn't want to live like that: she left the  village to go study and learn Spanish (her native language is Zapotec),  graduated from college with a degree in accounting and obtained a job as  a teacher. When she went back to her village. she found everything  exactly as she had left it, and decided it was time to change things:  she decided to run for mayor, even thought women couldnt vote and  political power was exclusively a men's business. Although people spread  rumors, ridiculed and threatened her, in 2007 she was allowed in the  election, mostly because the ruling family thought that nobody could  dare to violate the tradition and vote for a woman. To everybody's  surprise, Eufrosina won the election. However, the victory was not  accepted, and votes for her were thrown into the trash, while the former  mayor stated that "women do not exist here" and "women are create to  serve men". Eufrosina addressed human rights organizations and state  authorities, and the matter was taken seriously: the law was changed to  make sure that women had full access and rights to elections, and many  spoke for women's living conditions to be improved. In 2009 Eufrosina  was asked to participate in elections for the federal Chamber of  Deputies, but she refused inviting the parties to allow local women to  do so; in 2010 she became the first indigenous woman to become chair of  the local congress in the state of Oaxaca.‚Å†

Olympias  (~375-316 bc) became the queen consort of Macedonia when she married  kind Philip II. The marriage was tumultuous, and saw Olympias going into  voluntary exile and later being suspected of the assassination of the  king by hand of his personal bodyguard. With this death and the  execution of the second wife of the king and her spawn, Olympias ensured  the throne of Macedonia for her son, Alexander the Great. Alexander  tried to keep her away from politics, but during his campaigns her  influence was great both in Macedonia and Epirus, where she even served  as regent. After Alexander's death in Babylon, the succession to the  Macedonian throne was unsure and swinging with weddings being made and  broken: Olympias realized the crown rightfully owned by her grandson was  in danger, so she collected the Macedonian army, who supported her, and  invaded Macedonia to restore her power. She was successful at first,  but the king at the time managed to capture her and condemned her to be  executed. However, the soldiers refused: after all, she was the mother  of the legendary Alexander the Great. In the end, she had to be stoned  to death by the families of her many victims.‚Å†

Libby Lane  (1966-) is the Bishop of Derby in the Church of England, first woman to  hold such a charge after the general synod of the Church of England  voter do allow women to become bishops in 2014. She studied theology,  and was ordered deacon in 1993 and priest one year later. Her  appointment as bishop was called historic and an important step towards  gender equality in the Church. During her consecration, when the  archbishop asked the congregation if everybody agreed on her  consecration, an Anglo-Catholic priest intervened saying that "it's not  in the Bible" and her being a woman "an absolute impediment". Upon  asking a second time after explaining the legality of the act, the  archbishop wasn't interrupted again. One of her first duties as bishop  was the consecration of another bishop, who opposed women taking that  role. So rather than taking part in the laying of hands, she and other  bishops gathered in prayer, letting only three bishops on the laying of  hands ritual.‚Å†

Carmen Amaya  (~1915-1963) is known as "the greatest Flamenco dancer ever". She was  born to a Gypsy Spanish family, and started dancing accompanied by her  father, who played guitar for her while they were begging on the  streets. At the time, she was just 4 years old. She was soon introduced  to more prestigious scenes, but due to her young age she wasn't eligible  to work legally. This is one of the reasons the date on her birth  certificate might not be accurate. When the Spanish Civil War started,  Carmen and her troupe crossed the border to Portugal and from there took  a ship to South America: that's where she found her international  success, with full theaters and tickets sold out two months in advance.  Her fame is due to Carmen being the first female flamenco dancer to  master the high-speed and high-intensity footwork usually showed by the  best male dancers. Sometimes she showed her abilities and strong  character dancing in manly high-waisted trousers.‚Å†

Dolores  Huerta (1930-) was born in a Mexican immigrant family. As a kid she  often heard her dad telling stories of workers organizing in unions.  That's how she became an activist: she fought for improvements of  migrant farmer lifes, explaining that they were payed close to nothing,  had no rights, lived with no furniture and no clean water while working  sunrise to sundown without breaks. Workers often travel where the crops  are in season, and this meant that kids couldn't get a proper education.  In 1965 Dolores directed a national boycott of the grape industry,  resulting in a 3 year collective bargaining agreement with the United  Farm Workers. She has also done lobbying for laws to improve farm  workers lives: right to take driver's examination in Spanish, aids for  families with children and so on. She suffered from police beating  during a peaceful protest, and the recording of the event led to a  change in the police's crowd control techniques. She supports the idea  that the composition of parties and officers must reflect the ethnic  diversity of the nation, and encourages Latinas to run for office.‚Å†

Gracia Mendes  Nasi (1510-1569) was one of the wealthiest Jew women in the European  Renaissance. Her family, originally from Aragon in Spain, had fled to  Portugal so that they could still practice Judaism in the wake of forced  conversions. However, a few years later they also became Conversos when  all Jews of Portugal were forcibly converted to Catholicism. Gracia  married a very rich black pepper trader, in both a public catholic  wedding and a secret crypto-judaic (the hidden adherence to Judaism  while professing another religion) ceremony. Her husband died a few  years later, leaving part of his fortune to her. In the wake of a  Portuguese Inquisition, she moved to Antwerp where there was a branch  office of their house, and there started investing her money and making a  name for herself as businneswoman. Many tried to separate her from her  wealth, by arranging a marriage for her daughter: if that happened, the  fortune would have fallen under control of the daughter's husband.  Gracia resisted all these attempts, and used her fortune to influence  kings and popes. She tried to postpone the Inquisition, she protected  fellow Conversos and financed an escape network: Jews from Spain and  Portugal were loaded in her spice ships, and upon reaching Antwerp they  were given means to head to Venice and then to the Ottoman Empire that  at the time welcome Jews.‚Å†

Kumander  Liwayway (1919-2014) was a commander for the Huk rebellion in the  Philippines. As a teenager, she was interested in dressmaking and  perfumes, but upon Japanese invasion during WWII she went for a  different career. Her father had organized resistance against the  Japanese, and for this he was tortured and executed, and his corpse  displayed for everyone to see. Remedios Gomez-Paraiso, her real name,  was inspired to leave home and join the guerrilla forces, stating that  it was better than to die without putting up resistance. She first  served as a nurse, but was quickly promoted to commander of her military  squad, with her name meaning "Commander Dawn". She was known to fight  in formal wear and wearing red lipstick: she was fighting for the right  to be herself. Her squad fought off the Japanese during the Battle of  Kamansi, when they refused to retreat although heavily outnumbered. She  did not accept the victory over the Japanese as end of her fight: she  went on with the Huks against the new Philippine democracy that she  considered a farce.‚Å†

Masako H≈çj≈ç  (1156-1225) came from a family related to the Japanese imperial family,  but the clan decided to stay out of the rebellion about who was to be  the next emperor. Masako was the oldest of fifteen siblings, and was  instructed in horseriding, hunting and fishing. She also ate with the  men, rather than with the women of the household as it was custom.  Thanks to her husband's position, she took part in the government  administration and became a representation of men of the H≈çj≈ç clan. When  the H≈çj≈ç clan won the war and all of the opponent clan was eliminated,  Masako's husband was named shogun by the emperor, who died later the  same year. This made the man the most powerful man in Japan, and with  him also his wife and clan. Masako got the power when her husband died  and her son became shogun: the son was still young, so Masako, that in  the meantime became a Buddhist nun, created a council of regents in  which she held a lot of power. When her first son died assassinated, her  second son took the charge, but he was still an infant: Masako became  the de-facto shogun, and she went on consolidating their power managing  relationships and connections between the imperial and aristocratic  families, and administering justice and postwar rewards. She is the  representation of an era that acknowledged the authority and legitimacy  of women in ruling positions.‚Å†

Artemisia  Gentileschi (1593‚Äì1656) is considered to be one of the most accomplished  painters after the death of Caravaggio. She learnt the art of painting,  drawing and color mixing at her dad's atelier, where she showed much  more talent than her brothers. She did not kneel to the envy everybody  showed for her talent, and developed a style that focused on showing  strong and suffering women from myths, drawing them with mastery and  knowledge. She was the victim of a rape from her tutor, who was also a  family friend, but she didn't let this stop her, and the event probably  channeled her energy in portraying strong and powerful women, with  nothing to fear in comparison of male characters that were usual  subjects of her contemporary art.‚Å†

Gertrude  Elion (1918-1999) shared the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1988 thanks to  her work for rational drug design: instead of discovering new drugs by  trial and error, rational design is based on understanding the  biochemical properties of the target to come up with a dedicated  product. She was inspired to become a scientist after witnessing her  grandfather suffering of stomach cancer, and could attend college for  free thanks to her great grades. However after graduating she couldn't  find a paying research job because of her gender, and had to work as a  secretary and teacher before finding an unpaid position in a chemistry  lab. This problem kept her from obtaining interesting jobs for most of  her career, but finally she managed to get hired as an assistant to Mr.  Hitchings in a pharmaceutical company. That's where her work was the  most successful: thanks to her efforts that AZT, one of the first  effective AIDS drugs, was developed; she synthesized anti-cancer drugs  and created an immunosupressive drug used to fight rejection in organ  transplants.‚Å†

Bronis≈Çawa  Wajs (1908-1987) is one of the most famous Romani poets ever, and is  indeed commonly known with her Romani name of Papusza. She grew up in a  nomad band of families, and learned to read from lessons villagers gave  her in exchange for chickens. Her literacy was highly unusual, and  totally frowned upon. She was married really young, and this made her  unhappy: she started singing to take out her frustration, and soon she  was composing her own ballads based on traditional Romani storytelling.  Her poems often talked of the common theme of 'nostos', a return home:  for the Romani people this was used to describe the desire to take the  road, but when Papusza poems were published this was interpreted as her  yearning to settle down. She also published an interview that had a  little Romani-Polish dictionary attached to it: her people accused her  of giving out the secrets of her culture, and even to be a supporter of  the politics that wanted to force nomad people to settle. For this, she  was labelled as traitor, declared unclean and banished: she spent the  rest of her life alone writing about nostalgia, longing and feeling  lost, while her work was being popularized for its cultural importance.‚Å†

Agontim√©  (19th century) was considered the Queen Mother in the realm of Dahomey,  and her story connects West Africa and Brazil, through the slave trade  routes. The kingdom was an extremely well developed regional power, and  was entertaining international economic relationships with the European  countries that brought the slaves to the coast through the territory. In  this political situation, a conspiracy develops to kill the king, and  Agontim√© is part of it. The assassination is successful, but the new  king is the son of the deceased one, and starts punishing the  conspirators: some are buried alive, some are sacrificed during funeral  rites of the late king, and Agontim√© is deported to Brazil, where she is  sold as slave. In the Brazilian popular culture, Agontim√© is considered  a symbol of the African heritage of Brazil.‚Å†

Corrie ten  Boom (1892-1983) was part of a Dutch watchmaking family, who during WWII  helped Jewish people escape from the Nazis by hiding them in her home.  The family of Corrie was part of the Reformed Church, and there they  learned that the Jews were precious to God: this was one of the  motivations for helping them during the war, as "in this household,  God's people are always welcome." Their work providing refuge to Jewis  people became known to the Dutch resistance movement, which sent an  architect to build a secret room in the house where the Jews could hide  when Germans were sweeping the neighborhood. Additional help came  through connections made with charitable work, putting them in contact  with a men in charge of the ration cards and food coupons office, who  provided them with enough cards to give out to all the Jews they met,  helping them not to starve. However, not everybody agreed with this  work: an informant told the Nazis about the family secret activities,  and even though the secret room hiding Jews and resistance workers  remained undiscovered, material of the Resistance and extra ration cards  were found at their home. After being held in prison, they were sent to  a political concentration camp, where after the daily work they held  worship service with a Bible they had managed to smuggle in. Corrie was  released after almost a year of prison, and probably due to a clerical  error: a week after her release, all the women in her age group were  sent to the gas chambers.‚Å†
Corrie returned home and opened her doors  to the mentally disabled that were hiding in fear of execution, and  after the war set up a rehabilitation center for concentration-camp  survivors and sheltered Dutch who had collaborated with the Germans. She  was an example of unfailing charity, among others meeting and forgiving  two Germans that were cruel to her and her sister during their time in  prison.‚Å†

After getting a degree in  electrical engineering, together with her husband she founded Telecom  Technologies Inc, supplying software-implemented switching technology  that enabled telcom services to integrate existing networks to  next-generation networks. Anousheh supports the privatization of space,  the concept for which commercial companies could send equipment or  people to space independently from a government, for exploration or  other purposes. Through Space Adventures, Ltd. Anousheh has trained as a  backup for another astronaut, and upon his medical disqualification she  could join the Soyuz TMA-9 mission, joining the prime crew. With this  event, she became the first female space tourist, and on her 9 day stay  on the ISS she performed various space experiments for the European  Space Agency. With her flight, she hoped to inspire everyone worldwide,  but in particular young people and girls in the Middle Eastern countries  to not give up on their dreams and pursue them looking for  opportunities to make them happen. While some crewmates at the time  expressed concern over space tourists, one of the opinions was also that  the economical support they gave to the Russian space program was as  vital for the US space program, which relies heavily on the Soyuz.‚Å†
Interestingly,  Anousheh said that she does not consider herself a "space tourist" but  prefers the title of "spaceflight participant"‚Å†

Dana Scully  (fictional) is a medical doctor and FBI agent investigating unsolved  cases labeled "X-Files". The cases she works on are mostly related to  supernatural or to aliens, and while her partner Fox Mulder is more of a  "believer" she tries to stick to what science can prove. In her cases,  she often acts as forensic pathologist, performing or consulting on  autopsies of victims of the X-File cases.‚Å†
She was brought up  Catholic, although her career in science and medicine made her drift  away from the church. She couldn't completely get rid of her religious  believes, and the cases she worked on kept testing the limits of her  faith.‚Å†
The character of Dana Scully is described as one of the most  iconic character in the science-ficiton genre: during the serie she was  forced to question herself and grow due to circumstances, while showing  rationality and resilience to be better than her flaws.

Luisa  Capetillo (1879-1922) was homeschooled by her parents in Arecibo, Puerto  Rico, in a very liberal environment regarding philosophical and  political ideologies. Luisa found a job as a reader in a cigar-making  company, where people were hired to read novels and current vents to  workers. It is in this factory that she had her first contact to labor  unions, which further developed her ideals of anarchism and romanticism  that she had acquired through literature and through her mom's  education. Luisa started to write propaganda and essays, which were  published in radical and union newspapers, and she traveled through the  country educating and organizing women; on top of that she started her  own newspaper, called La Mujer, where she discussed of women's issues.  While reading for women laborers, she developed her feminist opinions,  and was considered Puerto Rico's first suffragist, and challenged the  mainstream society by wearing pants in public. These are Luisa's words  on social equality and feminism: "Oh you woman! who is capable and  willing to spread the seed of justice; do not hesitate, do not fret, do  not run away, go forward! And for the benefit of the future generations  place the first stone for the building of social equality in a serene  but firm way, with all the right that belongs to you, without looking  down, since you are no longer the ancient material or intellectual  slave."‚Å†

La Malinche  (~1500-1529) was a native woman from the Mexican Gulf, and is known for  contributing to the Spanish conquest of the Aztec empire. She was  possibly given away to slavery by her mother when her father died, so  that her brother could have the rights to heir. During her slavery she  learned multiple local languages, and her abilities later enabled her to  communicate with the Conquistadors. After the Aztec lost a battle  against the Spaniards, she was given as bounty to Cortes, for whom she  acted as interpreter, advisor and intermediary and who later chose her  as a consort. Her reputation has shifted over time, but always remaining  a powerful icon embodying conflicting aspects: from traitor of her own  people to quintessential victim to scheming temptress. Still nowadays in  Mexico the word "malinchista" means a disloyal compatriot, or a person  of a certain culture being attracted to another culture.‚Å†

Sister  Rosemary Nyirumbe lived through unsettling times in Uganda, while the  army of Joseph Koni kidnapped children and forced them to become  soldiers and commit atrocious crimes. Sister Rosemary opened centers  that welcome former abducted girls, that with their past of torture,  forced crimes and offspring from forced marriages to the rebels would  have otherwise nowhere to go. Her vocational school in Gulu has welcomed  more than 2000 girls, and while providing medical care and a safe place  for their children, the girls have been taught business skills,  secretarial studies, sewing and catering: these skills are fundamental  for them to go back to a life where they can sustain themselves, and to  help them heal from their traumas. Sister Roesemary built all of this  showing great ingenuity, as the resources for such a center have always  been scarce. But her success helped countless lifes, and earned her a  spot in Time's 100 Most Influential People in 2014.‚Å†

Isabella  of France (~1295-1358) arrived in England aged 12 as wife of King  Edward II. She supported her husband in these first years, and used her  relationship with the French monarchy to develop her own authority and  power. During a diplomatic mission in France, Isabella decided to depose  Edward, and returned to England with a mercenary army: the king's  forces deserted him, and she became queen regent on behalf of her son.  She was known for her diplomatic skills and intelligence, although she  was often portrayed as cruel and manipulative. During her reign she  resolved long-running problems like the wars with Scotland, but these  actions were unpopular, and together with her lavish spending  contributed to make her reign crumbling in favor of her son who assessed  his authority. Her actions made her be remembered as "femme fatale" in  many plays and literature over the years.‚Å†

Pauline L√©on  (1768-1838) was born in a family of chocolate makers, and started  helping with the business after her father died. Those were the years of  the French revolution, and Pauline got politically involved by  affiliating herself with the radical anti-royalists, to the point of  being part of the crowd that stormed the Bastille, carrying her own  pike. Her involvement was noteworthy, because she came from the artisan  class while most of the other involved women were aristocratic. During  the revolution, revolutionaries all over France were exploring the ideas  of men rights, and this stirred women to bring up the issue of women  rights and their place in society: Pauline addressed the Legislative  Assembly with a petition to create an all-female militia so that women  could protect their homes from counter-revolutionary assaults. This idea  was even more radical that it sounds nowadays, because the implied  right to bear arms was closely associated with full citizenship.‚Å†
Pauline's  positions got her arrested, but given that she had not committed any  major crime, she was released a few months later, and she decided to  pull herself from political scene to focus more on her occupation as a  schoolteacher.‚Å†

Laskarina  Bouboulina (1771-1825) was a Greek naval commander and is considered the  first woman-admiral of the Imperial Russian Navy. Laskarina took over  the fortune of her second husband, who was a shipowner and captain, when  he was killed in a battle against Algerian pirates. She made the  trading business prosper, and built 4 more ships, including a large  warship: she had to bribe Turkish officials to ignore the ship size, and  later this became the largest vessel in the hands of the Greek rebels  fighting for independence from the Ottomans.‚Å†
The Ottomans tried to  confiscate her property because of her late husband services for the  Russians, so she met the Russian ambassador and seekd his protection,  going into exile. She then returned, and although her name does not  appear in historical member lists of Greek independentist groups, she  organized her own troops, and used her fortune to provide food and  weapons for her sailors and soldiers. She joined forces with other  islands, and began a naval blockade; then arrived in Tripolis and  proceeded to save most of the female members of the sultan's household  during the fall of the Ottoman garrison.‚Å†
After her death, Tsar  Alexander I of Russia granted Laskarina the honorary rank of Admiral of  the Russian Navy, and in 2018 she was granted the title of Rear Admiral  in the Hellenic Navy.‚Å†

Odetta Holmes  (1930‚Äì2008) was known as "the Voice of Civil Rights Movement". It was a  teacher noticing her vocal talent, and encouraging her to pursue a  career: she started operatic training when she was 13 years old, and  then went on studying music while working as domestic help to support  herself. She joined various groups, touring the country, and in the 50s  after focusing on folk singing she started a solo career and she also  took up acting. Her singing inspired even bigger figures like Bob Dylan  and Janis Joplin, while being remembered for her singing of "O Freedom"  at the 1963 March on Washington: she is known as a civil rights and  human rights activist, but she describes her role as "one of the  privates in a very big army"‚Å†

Peggy  Guggenheim (1898-1979) was a socialite and art collector. She fell in  love with the bohemian artistic community while working in an  avant-garde bookstore in New York, and when she later moved to Paris she  got involved in the avant-garde community, befriending numerous writers  and artists. With the money that she inherited from her father (the  equivalent of about 40 millions), she opened a gallery for modern art in  London, called Guggenheim Jeune, and began collecting works of art: she  had a habit of purchasing at least one object from each of the  exhibitions at her gallery. However, the gallery wasn't profitable, so  she decided to create a museum for contemporary arts: she went to Paris  to negotiate loans for artworks for the first exhibition, but WWII made  her change plans and she ended up instead buying the works. Just a few  days before the Germans reached Paris, she fled to Southern France  together with her collection, and from there to New York, where she  opened a new gallery. After the war and a divorce, she moved to Venice,  where she continued collecting and promoting art until the 60s: at that  point, she started focusing on presenting what she already owned, making  the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Palazzo Venier dei Leoni the most  important museum in Italy for European and American art.‚Å†

Mona  Hatoum (1952-) is a Palestinian born and grown in Lebanon, where she  studied graphic design. Already as a kid she liked drawing and  illustration, although her family did not support her desire to pursue  art. The Lebanese Civil War broke out while Mona was visiting London,  and she was forced into exile, so she stayed in the UK. Her art  "explores human struggles related to political conflict, global inequity  and being an outsider", and her works try to get a physical response  that provokes emotional reactions: Mona's early works were mostly  performance pieces in which she directly confronted the audience. Her  work evolved, and she abandoned performances as too politically direct,  and started focusing on installations and object, with her art starting  to ask questions rather than making statements. For example, in her work  Keffieh she presents a scarf woven of human hair, bringing up questions  about the ideas of femininity and religion.‚Å†

Sofia  Ionescu (1920-2008) was the first female neurosurgeon in the world. She  was born in Romania, and her interest in medicine started when one of  her friends introduced her to her father, who happened to be a doctor.  After a friend died of infection following a brain surgery, she decided  to apply to medical school in Bucharest, supported by her mother. In her  first internship she studied ophthalmology, then spent a year in a  poorly equipped clinic during a typhus epidemic, and then volunteered to  take care of Soviet prisoners, entering surgical service and gaining  experience mostly in amputations. During the war, Bucharest was bombed,  and she was forced to perform an emergency brain surgery on an injured  boy, due to lack of more trained medical staff. She became certified in  1945, and went on forming the first neurological team of Romania, later  called "the Golden Team", and performed for almost 50 years before her  failing vision forced her to retire.‚Å†

Lowri Morgan  was a track and field runner, part of her city's athletic club, and ran  in 1500 meters events. She joined her university's rugby team and played  on the Welsh national team, but due to an injury she pulled the  cruciate ligaments and had to have a torn knee cartridge removed,  spending a year in a wheelchair. While doctors told her she was never  going to be able to run again, she stepped up to the challenge,  eventually receiving national honors in both cross country and rugby.  Besides being tv host and producer, and motivational speaker, Lowri is  mostly an ultramarathon runner: she is one of the few athlete to have  completed the 6633 Ultra in the Arctic, and the Amazon Ultra, in which  she suffered from stress fractures in her feet and had to use crutches,  but was the sole finisher. Both of these events were filmed and made  into documentaries. She said that in every extreme event she  participated she suffered from hallucinations, loneliness and crippling  pain, but her passion for pushing boundaries is far stronger than any  discomfort she has ever faced.‚Å†

Jane  Dieulafoy (1851-1916) got married the same year that the  Franco-Prussian war began, and when her husband volunteered and was sent  to the front she decided to accompany him, wearing the uniform and  fighting by his side. This habit of wearing men's clothing (illegal in  France but for which she later received special permission, and that she  said was only to save time buying ready-made suites) and wearing her  hair short came in handy during her travels, it would have been  difficult otherwise for a woman like her to travel Muslim countries.  That's where she went the end of the war, spending 10 years traveling in  Egypt and Morocco with her husband for archaeological and exploration  work, although it was only later during trips to Persia that Jane  started documenting the travels and works through photographs,  illustrations and writing. These documents have been collected and later  published. Her most notable work happened in the city of Susa, which  used to be capital of Elam and the Acaemenid Empire: together with her  husband, she found numerous artifacts and friezes, many of them were  shipped back to France to display at the Louvre. Two rooms in the museum  contain objects brought back during those missions, and although the  transfer of the artifacts caused considerable damage to the finding of  Iranian archaeological excavations, the French government honored her  with the title of Chevalier of the Legion of Honor. ‚Å†

Nicole Marthe  Le Douarin (1930-) intended to study literature, but a talented science  teacher awakened her interest in biology. She went on to earn a PhD,  but not without difficulties: the university dean tried to stop her as  he disapproved of married women on the same faculty with their husbands,  and while she was in the end appointed she was not given laboratory  space or a budget, and was mostly loaded with teaching duties. Nicole  still managed to continue her researches on avian embryos, working on  chimeric embryos of chicken and quails. She invented a staining  technique of specific cells that would allow her to follow the  development of such cells in the embryo, finding out which contribution  to the growth was given by which original embryo. This enabled her  to  study the development of higher animal nervous system and immune  systems.‚Å†
For this she was admitted in multiple highly regarded scientific societies and received many awards.‚Å†

Selma  Lagerl√∂f (1858-1940) was the first woman to win the Nobel Prize for  Literature, and the first woman to be granted a membership in the  Swedish Academy, and later became the first woman to be depicted on a  Swedish banknote. Since she was a child she loved reading, and grew up  with her grandmother telling her stories of fairy tales and fantasy. As  the schooling system in her area wasn't fully developed at the time, she  got schooled at home, and soon decided that she would be a writer when  she grew up and she started writing poetry, although she didn't publish  anything until later in life. She started to work as a teacher, but the  success of her books allowed her to focus on writing: inspired by her  trips she wrote some more and got great success, to the point of being  compared to Shakespeare and Homer. Selma had close relationships with  two women, who supported and criticized her work, although there were  strong rivalry issues. Because homosexual relations were taboo and  illegal in Sweden at the time, and because the language boundaries  between expressions of friendship and love were quite vague, the things  that can be said of those relationships are that they were close,  emotional and exclusive. The Nobel Prize was awarded to her in  appreciation of her idealism, vivid imagination and spiritual  perception, and the money allowed her to buy back her father's estate in  which she lived for the rest of her life. At the start of WWII, she  sent her Nobel Prize medal and gold medal from the Swedish Academy to  Finalnd to help raise money to fight the Soviet Union: the Finnish  government was so touched that it raised the necessary money by other  means and returned the medals to her.‚Å†

Nellie  Melba (1861-1931) studied singing in Melbourne and made a modest  success there, but she moved to Europe searching for a better singing  career. Her first attempt in London didn't go well, being criticized as  having a respectable voice but lacking personal charm seen as necessary  to become a great figure in the lyric scene. So she left England, and in  Paris she got a totally opposite critique: not only her voice was  described as having great flexibility, but also her acting was praised  for being expressive and striking. From that moment, Nellie's success  kept growing, although interestingly her repertoire was rather small: in  her whole career she sang no more than 25 roles, and was closely  identified with only ten. Also, she only sung a little German opera,  focusing instead on French and Italian pieces. Even with these  restrictions, Nellie became one of the most famous singers of the late  Victorian era, and was the first Australian to get international  recognition as classical musician. To her memory, the Australian $100  note features her image.‚Å†

Freydis  Eiriksdottir (~970, legend) is a strong-willed woman appearing in both  of the Vinland sagas, Icelandic texts written in the 13th century to  describes events occurred around the year 1000, when the Norse people  discovered and explored North America, known as "Wineland" for the  presence of grapevines. The most detailed tale of Freydis portrays her  as a woman that wanted the prestige and wealth associated with a Vinland  journey. She organized the trip with two other men, and got permission  to use the homes that her own brother had already build in Vinland. Once  there, claiming she was beaten by the two men that organized the trip  with her, she forced her husband to take revenge by assassinating them  and their men in their sleep, and when the husband refused to kill the  women, Freydis herself took an axe and massacred them. While upon  returning to Greenland the word of what she had done was spreading, she  kept threatening everybody who brought up the topic, and even her own  brother couldn't bring himself to punish her.‚Å†
A second different  tale says instead that Freydis, part of a Vinland expedition while eight  months pregnant, witnessed how the Nordic men panicked and tried to  flee when the natives attacked their camp with catapults. She yelled at  the men accusing them of being cowards, but nobody listened to her. So  she picked up a sword and engaged the natives, which quickly surrounded  her. That's when Freydis undid her garment and started beating the sword  upon her breast, at which point the natives retreated and fled. For  this gesture, Freydis was praised by all of the survivors.‚Å†
Freydis  is also one of the pivot characters of the recent novel Civilizations by  Laurent Binet, in which her reach of South America starts a  technological development that will result in the Incas colonizing  Europe.‚Å†

Sophie  Germain (1776-1831) was 13 years old when the Bastille fell during the  French revolution, and the instability of the city forced her to stay  indoor: for entertainment, she started going through her father's  library, and got intrigued by the books about mathematics, and in  particular of geometry. She even taught herself latin and greek, so that  she could read ancient treaties. ‚Å†
Sophie's parents didn't approve  of her interest, deeming it inappropriate for a woman, and started  denying her warm clothes and a fire for her bedroom trying to stop her  from studying: after they left, she would wrap herself in quilts, take  out candles and do mathematics. After some time, her mother finally  starting supporting her, although secretly.‚Å†
While the university  system prevented her from taking part to the lessons due to her gender,  the education system made the lecture notes available to all who asked:  she obtained them, and started submitting her work with the name of a  former student. When the faculty member Lagrange noted the intelligence  of such works he requested a meeting in person, and Sophie was forced to  disclose her identity: luckily Lagrange didn't mind that she was a  woman, and become her mentor. Sophie kept learning, and was recommended  for an honorary degree, which she never obtained: due to her sex, she  was never able to make a career out of mathematics, and had to work to  support herself. But her scientific results were astounding: her work on  Fermat's Last Theorem was used as base of work for decades to come, and  she won the Paris Academy of Science grand prize for her essay on  elasticity theory explaining why sand arranges itself in a pattern when  put on a vibrating glass surface. For this last problem a public was  issued in France, and Sophie was the only one submitting her work, after  six years of research. In her honor, the Academy of Science established  the Sophie Germain Prize.‚Å†

Geraldine  Farrar (1882-1967) started studying music at age 5, and was giving  recitals by age 14. Her soprano voice made her a sensation in all the  opera companies in which she worked, and she developed a great  following, in particular among New York's young female opera goers.  Similar to most fanbases nowadays, even those girls had a name: they  were known as Gerry-Flappers. Geraldine also acted in a dozen silent  films, produced between opera seasons, and her acting skills were highly  praised. Contrary to what other opera singers did, Geraldine never  sacrificed dramatic action for tonal perfection, and therefore managed  to achieve highly emotional performances in her roles. She was awarded  two stars in the Hollywood Walk of Fame.‚Å†

Alakhai Beki  (~1191-1230) was a daughter of Genghis Kahn, who was married off to a  relative of the king of a southern tribe. The plan of Genghis Kahn was  that in doing so she would provide him with a way out of the Gobi  desert, while supplying him with horses and provisions in his conquest  wars. However, the plan didn't work: the tribe revolted against Alakhai  and tried to kill her, forcing her to run away with her stepsons while  the rest of her family and supporters were killed. Alakhai rejoined his  dad in the Mongol army, and upon hearing of what had happened, Genghis  Kahn sent forces to suffocate the revolt and to exterminate all male  members of the tribe as retaliation. It is Alakhai that persuaded him  not to do this, and instead just punish the murderers of her family:  thanks to her act, this is the only tribe conquered by Genghis Kahn that  rebelled and managed to survive. After the revolt, the tribe became  loyal to Alakhai, and she was also left in charge of all the conquered  Chinese territories, which she governed with the help of all-women  political counselors.‚Å†

Emily Hahn  (1905-1997) loved reading and writing, and therefore enrolled in the  general arts program at university. However, she quickly changed the  course to mining, after being prevented from enrolling in a class taken  mainly by engineering students. She was the first woman to enroll in  that degree, and despite her colleagues and professors being all but  enthusiast ("the female mind is incapable of grasping [...] any of the  fundamentals of mining taught" said one of her professors!), she  graduated  in 1926. During her life she traveled a lot, and the letters  that she sent to her brother-in-law describing her experiences  jumpstarted her career as a writer: when describing her travels across  the US dressed as a man, he was secretly forwarding her letters to The  New Yorker. She traveled to the Belgian Congo and hiked across Central  Africa, before spending a few years in Shanghai: the reason she was  giving for these adventures was often "nobody said not to go", and  wherever she went she was getting noticed, for example for her pet  monkey.‚Å†
All these experiences were put into her writing, and her  novels in the 20th century played a significant role in opening up Asia  and Africa to the west. Emily is often considered an early feminist, and  The New Yorker called her "a forgotten American literary treasure"‚Å†

Elizabeth  Peratrovich (1911-1958) was an American civil rights activist, and Gran  President of the Alaska Native Sisterhood. Part of the Tlingit nation,  she became concerned about racial discrimination and inequities after  marrying and having children: with her family she moved to Juneau, and  became one of the first indigenous families to live in a non-native  neighborhood and whose kids went into public schools. In Juneau  Elizabeth was looking for lawmakers that could effect change, but even  there she found extensive social and racial discrimination against  Alaska native people. With her husband, she started to lobby Alaska  lawmakers, the governor, and others to advocate for the passage of  anti-discrimination legislation, bringing the issue up to the Aslaska  Senate, where Elizabeth testified with a passionate speech. Her  activities led to Alaska becoming the first territory to end segregation  laws, nearly 20 years before the US Congress passed the Civil Rights  Act. In 2020, the United States Mint released a $1 gold coin inscribed  with Elizabeth's likeness in honor of her historic achievements.‚Å†
