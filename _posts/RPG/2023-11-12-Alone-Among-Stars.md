### Let's roll

Planet 1: **Terra** \
**1** card

- Day 1 - **Jack of Hearts ; 6** \
I am well rested so I look out of the window during the launch. I can see the pyramids in the Egyptian desert... makes me think how impressive humanity is.

Planet 2: **Greenhouse** \
**3** cards

- Day 4 - **9 of Clubs ; 4** \
We were not expecting on this barren planet to enter a cave and discover such luxurious vegetation. It's warmer and more humid than outside so in insight it makes sense that they grow here.

- Day 5 - **King of Spades ; 6** \
Now we understand how photosynthesis works: we laid down to rest, but when we turned off our lamps we could still see! The evaporation of the vegetation forms luminescent clouds. Quite impressive to witness!

- Day 6 - **Jack of Diamonds ; 2** \
Back on the surface and preparing to leave the planet, we could finally see the local sunset. As soon as the light was gone, the desert itself started beaming of so many beautiful colors. Must be some microbioma, seems that fluorescence and luminescence are popular on this planet! Sadly, we do not have the equipment to analyze it.

Planet 3: **Amazonas** \
**4** cards

- Day 10 - **5 of Diamonds ; 1** \
We named the planet based on the intricate and flourishing vegetation, we couldn't even land properly. Luckily the treetops seem to hold us, and our position allowed the population of little monkeys of a bright blue color to look at us with as much interest as we look at them.

- Day 11 - **Ace of Spades ; 1** \
The monkeys disappeared all of a sudden, so we followed them. They all went to an opening in the trees and waited. We felt the rumbling first, then an enormous geyser erupted, an immense pillar of bright blue water. We stepped back but the monkeys showered in it: this might be where they get their color from.

- Day 12 - **Queen of Clubs ; 1** \
We sent a drone to investigate the geyser, and it did not come back. The last image is the placid surface opening like a mouth and sucking in the drone in a whirl that looked a lot like a tentacle. That is quite worriesome.

- Day 13 - **6 of Spades ; 4** \
How many more surprises on this planet? Too bad it's time to fly home, but there seems to be a lot of phenomena worth investigating. For example, this morning we woke up and it had snowed. Actual fluffy freezing snow.

# Review
This was such a relaxing experience. No existential dread, just a lot of curiosity about what could possibly be waiting to get discovered on the next day, let alone the next planet. Of course, one could play with carnivorous rocks and corrosive clouds if that is what he likes... but there is no pressure in solving a situation for the best or the worse, you could just be looking out of your spaceship window and scribbling about the panorama. Or not, and you would dress up and go exploring.

There are no reference tables apart from the card prompts: if it's a day when you lack inspiration, the game could get monotonous quite quickly. Exactly for this situation I like to use an illustrated deck: if nothing comes to my mind based on the prompt, I can look at the card and see if the drawings bring any idea.
