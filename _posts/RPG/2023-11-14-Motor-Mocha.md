{: .notice--info}

> This is a contemplative solo RPG in which you play as the last remaining barista on staff at a once-busy drive-through coffee shop during the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020.

Not sure I would have wanted to play it while in lockdown... but as of now, I am all for brewing a cup of coffee and giving it a try.

# Gameplay

### Timing
The author suggests to play over multiple days, to simulate working days. \
I don't have that kind of time, so... between 5 and 40 minutes, depending on how (un)lucky you roll.

### Tools
- 1 d6
- 1 d20
- a deck of tarot cards

That's it. You might want to add a notepad if you want to keep track of your adventures.

### Setup
To set the mood and the pace of the game, having a coffeeshop playlist is suggested. It does not play any part in the mechanics, so that can be skipped. \
Also, you should have a list of 20 names corresponding to the usual customers. I will make that up when I flip the relevant cards.
	
### Let's roll

Day 1: 3 cards, business as usual \
**Queen of cups ; 2**: a lady looking quite worried and a bit constipated. She orders a black tea, hope she wasn't sick. \
**3 of cups ; 20**: a car of teenagers, frappuccinos for everybody. They were listening to some good punk-rock, I liked that! \
**The Tower ; 4**: no more customers for today, but the owner is sick and will infect us if he visits in the next 4 days.

Day 2: 15 cards + 3 because of nice weather \
**Knight of wands ; 4**: just an espresso for this man, he kept saying that he was in a hurry! \
**8 of swords ; 8**: this man smelled so strong of gasoline and yet was smoking a cigarette... while pulling his americano I could only hope he wasn't going to catch fire \
**The Moon**: it's nice to see Danny, his eyes smile even with the mask on \
**6 of coins ; 11**: this one got a cream coffee to celebrate she got vaccinated. Pleasently surprising, given the car full of religious stickers. \
**Knight of cups ; 9**: serving lattes to a customer and his mistress while he is on the phone talking about his divorce... fun stuff \
**Page of coins ; 5**: "Four coffees to go and make it quick, I am late for the meeting" that sounds a lot like not my problem \
**10 of wands ; 3**: such a well dressed lady, I hope she doesn't spill the tea on her dress! \
**The Sun**: Nadine comes in with her newborn \
**The Magician**: I can never figure out what Jonah's car smells of. Maybe cinnamon? \
**7 of wands ; 1**: this hippie guy was coughing non-stop, blaming it on smoking too much. I gave him his iced coffee, and hoped it was really the smoking. \
â†’ I will be working another 5 days before the symptoms arise.


# Review
I didn't go through all of this. I love the idea and the approach feels right, but this felt like playing "Guess Who" against nobody... more than making me dread the virus, it made me dread being a barista. The game has potential, but like this it is unripe and needs to be refined with something that makes playing it relevant.

The idea of using tarots is really nice, but the game lacks mechanics to make the most out of it. The core of the experience is "describe this new customer": there is no incentive to come up with a conversation with them, no "make a drink and maybe get a bonus" mechanic, no "you got the virus here is a malus", no nothing apart trying to answer the questions "how does the customer look" and maybe "what did the customer order". Too bad.
