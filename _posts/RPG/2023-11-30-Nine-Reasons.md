> For those of us who wake up weeping in the middle of the night beneath our wall of swords.

I am not sure this will make me feel better and not worse... but can't say for sure if I didn't try! \
This will be a deeply personal game, so feel free to pretend I didn't write about any awkward topic.

# Gameplay

### Timing
15 minutes, depending how quick you can go though the lists.

### Tools
You might want to have a notepad if you want to keep track of your lists, but thinking about them is enough.

### Setup
No setup needed, start listing right away!
	
### Let's roll

Ok, I have to say I had my playthrough written out, but I decided to remove it. On one side, it really got too personal. On the other side, it would spoil the entire game. But I can still say how it works: on the first part, you are asked to write shorter and shorter lists of things that tend to be negative, either about yourself or about the world. Then you take a deep breath or two, check in with yourself, and move to the second part in which you write longer and longer lists of things that are positive.


# Review
Is this game supposed to make me feel better? Because it did not. Maybe it's the goal, to just reflect on what is going on and how one perceives things.

At mid game, I was feeling totally sad and inadequate. At the end of the game... who am I gonna fool, I didn't get to the end of the game: I run out of positive things to write down. At some point the positive got so ridiculously irrelevant that it felt like cheating just to try and get at the end of the list.
Is it a known cognitive bias the fact that we recall the negative better than the positive? Yes, it is. Do I want to spend my evening playing a game that triggers exactly that bias and then leaves me hanging and feeling like crap? Nope, definitely not. Too bad.
