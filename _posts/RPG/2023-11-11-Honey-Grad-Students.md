### Let's roll

Why am I even in a chemistry lab, as a history major?? \
**10** → I remember I was looking for dry ice to cool down some drinks, it's hot this summer!

Not sure what happened, can I figure out where I am? \
**12** → I opened the cold-room door, put in a hand searching for the light switch and touched something strange. So I guess I am right outside the door of the fridge cellar. Being inside would have been worse!

Being small didn't make my thirst any smaller! I need to find water now. \
**6 ; 4** → The only sink is high above the desks, way out of reach. Maybe the cold-room door has some condensation? \
**9** → Yes it does! I can drink it and get a bit refreshed. I will just ignore the odd taste.

Ok, focus on the sink. Can I climb the table to get to it? \
**3-1 ; 2** → Turns out that nope, the legs are really slippery and I found that out only after losing my grip and landing badly on my ankle.

Can I still walk? \
**8** → Barely but yes. Let's walk around and see what we can find.

Maybe somebody left a coat on a chair and I can climb on it? \
**6 ; 5** → Yes, but I didn't think that now I would be stuck on the chair. Not much better.

Can I at least get some rest sheltering in a pocket of the coat? \
**9** → Yes, and I even find some crumbs of a snack... I will eat this so I can feel better.

I see the upper drawer of the desk is open, can I jump until there? \
**9** → Yes, the chair was close enough that with a bit of courage I manage to jump over.

Is there any stationery to build a ladder to the desk? \
**8** → Yes, the ruler is long enough to be put up and used as a ramp.

Is there any danger on the desk? \
**10** → No danger in sight, the way is free to the sink!

Does the sink have an easy-to-use lever, or a knob? \
**5 ; 1** → Bad luck, it has a knob... and is this red sticky puddle blood?? Oh no, from the fear I walk back and fall into the sink.

Anything in the sink I can use to climb out? \
**7 ; 3** → Nothing at all, and the walls are really slippery.

It's going to be a long wait until somebody comes and notices me... Do I at least have a little bit of water from the dripping tap? \
**7 ; 1** → No dripping from the sink, just more of the red substance that scared me before. The only thing I can do is sit in a corner and weep.

# Review
Such a creative setting, so many possibilities to create chaos! Too bad I ended up using the table pretty much as a yes/no oracle, no much variation came up during my game. The mechanics are for storytelling more than for roleplaying, and they probably work better if you play with a few friends that got shrunk with you.

I missed a time tracker or health tracker, that would have put a bit more of urgency into the game. Also, as a simple improvement for solo games, I would swap out one of the entries of the "Complications" table with a random encounter: without a GM suggesting that, I was too focused on the actions to think about putting a scary cockroach in there!
