Adrienne Clarkson (1939-) arrived in Canada when she was 3 years old, as a refugee from Hong Kong, which was occupied by the Japanese. She grew up to be a writer, a journalist and a TV show host. \
In 1999, Queen Elizabeth gave her approval to Adrienne becoming the governor general of Canada: Adrienne was the first minority and the first without a political or military background to get that office.‚Å† \
