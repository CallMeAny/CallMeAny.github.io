We want to show women that dreamed big and achieved those dreams. We want to show women that worked hard and didn't let the world kick them down. We want to show women that ended up making history and changing the world, in baby steps of giant leaps.⁠ We want to inspire you. ⁠ \

We try to be objective and respectful, and we invite you to do the same. Some of the ladies in this pages are role models, some are examples of what can be achieved but definitely not good examples by the means they used. Morality is important, so our stories are here to make you think, not for you to follow blindly. ⁠\

This is an archive of my long-abandoned Instagram page. Hopefully one day I will have time and motivation to get back to it: there are so many stories that are still worth sharing, and I would love to be able to do exactly that.
