Adele Goldberg (1945-) is a Jewish computer scientist who grew up in Chicago. She was part of the developers who came up with the programming language Smalltalk, from which the object-oriented programming approach and the concept of graphical user interface developed. \
Also she came up with design patterns that are still widely used in software architecture. Her ideas were used by Steve Jobs as a basis for the Macintosh environment.‚Å† \
