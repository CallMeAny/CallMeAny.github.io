Agnodice (legend) is credited as the first female midwife or even obstetrician (which requires more formal education in medicine) in ancient Athene. \
Her story says that she practiced as physician disguised as a man, because at the time medicine was a forbidden practice to women. She tried to tend to women in labor who were ashamed to consult male doctors, so her success among lady patients rose easily above that of male doctors. These were jealous of her, and accused her of seducing her patients. \
During her trial, Agnodice lifted her clothes, revealing that she was a woman: her charges changed to breaking the law that forbid ladies in medicine, and only thanks to the defense of wives of important Athenians the law was changed. ‚Å†\
