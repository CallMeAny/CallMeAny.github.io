Agontim√© (19th century) was considered the Queen Mother in the realm of Dahomey, and her story connects West Africa and Brazil, through the slave trade routes. \
The kingdom was an extremely well developed regional power, and was entertaining international economic relationships with the European countries that brought the slaves to the coast through the territory. In this political situation, a conspiracy develops to kill the king, and Agontim√© is part of it. \
The assassination is successful, but the new king is the son of the deceased one, and starts punishing the conspirators: some are buried alive, some are sacrificed during funeral rites of the late king, and Agontim√© is deported to Brazil, where she is sold as slave. In the Brazilian popular culture, Agontim√© is considered a symbol of the African heritage of Brazil.‚Å† \
