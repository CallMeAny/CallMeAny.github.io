Ada E. Yonath (1939-) is born in Jerusalem and later moved to Tel Aviv. She was accepted into high school, but she could not pay tuition so instead she gave math lessons to others students in return. \
She became a crystallographer, studying the position of atoms in crystalline solids. Thanks to her researches, she could explain how some antibiotics work, and how drug resistance develops: human ribosomes are slightly different than the ones in microbes, and therefore they can be targeted by medicament. \
These researches led her to win the Nobel prize for chemistry in 2009, with two co-recipients.‚Å†
