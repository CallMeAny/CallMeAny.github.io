Joan Beauchamp Procter (1897-1931) was always influenced by the family interest in arts and science. Although chronically affected by health problems, she could pursuit her curiosity in natural history in the big gardens of her home. She had a special lover for amphibians and reptiles, often keeping snakes and lizards as pets, and at some point even a crocodile. Although her health prevented her from having an active lifestyle, she kept correspondence with many researchers in the field, and affirmed herself as an expert with works on animals like the Komodo dragon. She worked on taxonomies, and made innovative contributions to veterinary practice and zoo displays.‚Å†
