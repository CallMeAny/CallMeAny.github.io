Carmen Amaya (~1915-1963) is known as "the greatest Flamenco dancer ever". She was born to a Gypsy Spanish family, and started dancing accompanied by her father, who played guitar for her while they were begging on the streets. At the time, she was just 4 years old. She was soon introduced to more prestigious scenes, but due to her young age she wasn't eligible to work legally. This is one of the reasons the date on her birth certificate might not be accurate. When the Spanish Civil War started, Carmen and her troupe crossed the border to Portugal and from there took a ship to South America: that's where she found her international success, with full theaters and tickets sold out two months in advance. Her fame is due to Carmen being the first female flamenco dancer to master the high-speed and high-intensity footwork usually showed by the best male dancers. Sometimes she showed her abilities and strong character dancing in manly high-waisted trousers.‚Å†
