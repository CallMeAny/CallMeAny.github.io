Vera Atkins (1908-2000) worked for British Special Operations Executive (SOE) during WWII. At the start of the war, she was part of the team that evacuated the Polish who managed to break the code of the Enigma machine. Vera was born in Romania, and after her studies abroad lived there until the antisemitism and extremism forced her and her mother to emigrate to Britain. In 1941 Vera joined the SOE as a secretary, and was soon promoted to intelligence officer in charge of recruiting British agents and deploying them to occupied France, especially regarding the women agents working as couriers and wireless operators. Vera had to make sure that their clothing and papers were appropriate for the mission, kept in touch with their families and took care of everybody receiving their salaries.‚Å†
After the war, Vera put a lot of effort in trying to find all the missing agents of her section, who had been secretly killed or deported by the Germans: the spies in France and Paris were known by the Germans, and it remains controversial whether Vera realized that her agents were being targeted, or whether she dismissed the omitted contacts or wrong code words as the agents feeling safe enough to do so.‚Å†
