Mary Kom (1983-) is an Indian Olympic boxer: she is the only woman to become World Amateur Boxing champion for 6 times, and the only woman boxer to have won a medal in each one of the seven world championships. As a kid, she helped her parents with farming jobs, and in school she took part to many different sports. She started boxing after seeing a fellow Manipuri winning gold in the 1998 Asian games. At first she had to keep her interest hidden from her father, who was worried that being hit would ruin her face and her chances of marriage, but he later started supporting her when he understood her love for the sport. Thanks to her achievements she is nicknamed Magnificent Mary, and has received many nominations and prizes.⁠
