Juana Gal√°n (1787-1812) rose to fame during the Peninsular War, when Napoleonic forces wanted to take control of Spain and Portugal. She lived in Valdepe√±as and knew how to collect information by keeping her hears open while working at the tavern at the entrance of the village. When Napoleon's troops attacked the village and not enough men were available to defend it, she encouraged women to take the fight: she is depicted smashing the soldiers that crossed her path with a baton or even with a cast-iron pan, while other women poured hot water and boiling oil on the roads. Their efforts helped the decisions of the French army to abandon the region, and the town was given the title of "very heroic".‚Å†
