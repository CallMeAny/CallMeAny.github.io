Jackie Ormes (1911-1985) is known as the first African-American woman cartoonist, and she showed her talent as cartoonist already in high school, drawing caricatures of other students and teachers. In the same period she started writing for a newspaper, covering boxing matches for the Pittsburgh Courier. She also enjoyed writing as a freelancer about police beats, court cases and human interests topics, but what she really wanted to do was draw. She managed to get her strip published: Torchy Brown depicted a black Mississippi teen who moved to New York and found fame and fortune singing and dancing in the Cotton Club. Another of her characters, Patty-Jo, was made into a doll: it was the first American black doll to have an extensive wardrobe and differently from most dolls at the time it represented a real girl and not a mammy or double-sided figure. Patty-Jo dolls had a big success both among black and white girls, and they are nowadays collector items.‚Å†
