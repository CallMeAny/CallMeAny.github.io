Amna Al Haddad (1989-) is a weightlifting athlete from United Arab Emirates. She started her career in 2007 and a few years later she competed in the Crossfit Games Open. She is Muslim, and therefore she competes wearing a headscarf and a unitard: she hopes that her results will help inspire other women, and although she has not been selected to participate in the Olympics she will continue practicing her sport.⁠
