Julia Child (1912-2004) was born in California, where she received an education majoring in History. During WWII she worked at a US intelligence agency, where she moved her first steps into cooking while experimenting different recipes for sharks repellents. She married with Paul, who introduced her to fine cuisine and who she followed to Paris. In Paris she attended Le Cordon Bleu cooking school, and from there her cooking career really started: her first book and masterpiece is Mastering the Art of French Cooking.‚Å†
