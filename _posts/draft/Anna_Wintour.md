Anna Wintour (1949-) showed her strong fashion sense at an early age, when in school she began rebelling against strict dress codes by taking up the hemlines of her skirts. Already at age 14 she started wearing her hair in a bob, style that nowadays is iconic especially when complemented with dark sunglasses. She cultivated her interests in fashion with magazines, among which Seventeen that her grandmothers sent her from the US. Anna's father, editor of the Evening Standard, started consulting her for ideas on how to increase the young readers of the newspaper. She started working as editorial assistant in fashion journalism, but due to disagreements with colleagues, she moved to New York: working again in fashion magazines, she got fired after nine months due to her innovative shoots that the editor didn't appreciate. She took time without working, but kept up her photo shoots, and finally they become appreciated when she became the fashion editor of New York. She pretty much discovered how effective was in sales putting a celebrity on the cover of a magazine, and the editor at the time was willing to bend rules to let her work spread out. In 1985 she got her first editorship of Vogue, in the UK: she reorganized the magazine, earning her fame as a difficult and demanding boss, but her aim was to target "a new kind of woman out there, she's interested in business and money. She doesn't have time to shop anymore. She wants to know what and why and where and how."‚Å†
