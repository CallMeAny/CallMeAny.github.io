The Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer was the grandfather of the general purpose computers that we use nowadays. During WWII it was used to calculate artillery trajectories, much much faster than what humans could do. The ENIAC was manned by Jean Jennings, Marlyn Wescoff, Ruth Lichterman, Betty Snyder, Frances Bilas, and Kay McNulty: they had to program it by wiring the portable function tables, and this was done by setting 1200 10-way switches after solving differential equations. During the war there was a shortage of male engineers, so the army hired female "human calculators" who were doing the work by hand. From these ladies, six were chosen for a secret project, and after a short training they were left to figure out how the machine worked and how to program it. ‚Å†
