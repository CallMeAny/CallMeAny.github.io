Carol Shaw (1955-) is one of the first female game designer and programmer in the video game industry. When she was a kid, instead of playing with dolls she preferred messing around with her brother's railroad models, and, after discovering computers in high school, she started playing text-based games. In 1978 she started working with Atari, where she developed some games but also worked on the complex parts that actually render the images on the screen, and on the kernel of the system. Her big success is River Raid, a vertical scrolling shooter that she created for Activision, still for the Atari platform. Thanks to her career, in 2017 she received the Industry Icon Award at The Game Awards.‚Å†
