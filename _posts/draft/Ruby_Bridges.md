Ruby Bridges (1954-) was the first African-American child to desegregate an all-white elementary school in New Orleans school system. After the federal law called for mixed schools, entry exams where created to try and keep the black children out. Ruby passed her exams, and her mom decided that she was to enter the William Frantz Elementary School. Federal marshals had to escort her, because people outside of the school where shouting and throwing things. White families pulled their kids out of the school and only one teacher agreed to teach her. She was very brave and never cried.‚Å†
