Alice Guy-Blach√© (1873-1968) was a french filmmaker, and the first to make narrative fiction. In fact, she was most probably the first filmmaker in the world. She grew up between Europe and South America, and started working as a typist and stenographer (brand new jobs at the time) to support herself and her mother after her dad died. She was working as a secretary in a camera manufacturing company, and after seeing the screening by the Lumi√®res brothers she just asked if she could try to make her own movie. The title was "The Cabbage Fairy" and was described as "chaste fiction of children born under the cabbages in a wonderfully framed chromo landscape".‚Å†
