Yusra Mardini (1998-) is a Syrian swimmer currently living in Germany. Already in 2012 she represented Syria in the FINA World Swimming Championships, but due to the civil war she had to flee her country in 2015. She planned to reach Greece with a boat from Turkey, but midway in the Aegean sea the extremely overcrowded dinghy stopped working and began to take on water. After throwing their luggage in the water and seeing that the situation didn't improve, Yusra, her sister and another person who could swim jumped in and started towing the boat. After three hours and a half of effort, they finally reached the shore of Lesbos, from where they could continue to Europe and ask for asylum. In Berlin, Yusra continued training and managed to qualify for the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio, where she took part to the 100m freestyle and the 100m butterfly. In 2017, she became a representative of the UnderArmour sports brand.⁠
