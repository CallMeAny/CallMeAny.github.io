Sarraounnia (XIX century) is an African hero, seen a symbol of Pan-Africanism. Her name is in fact a title, meaning "queen": in a period where most of the African populations surrendered without fight against the invading French, Sarraounnia led her Aznas community in battle against the colonial troupes. One of the reports of the battle that she sustained says the she was the one starting hostilities, by sending a message saying that she was going to block the road to the French soldiers with her invincible warriors. The tribe couldn't stand long in battle, and the French could quickly move on, but not without leaving deaths and injured on the ground. The Aznas took refuge in the forest, and came back to their village as soon as the French left.‚Å†
