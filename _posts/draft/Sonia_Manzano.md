Sonia Manzano (1950-) joined Sesame Street in 1971, and she eventually started writing scripts for the serie, for which she won 15 Emmy Awards. In the show, she covered the role of Maria for 44 years. She also performed in The Vagina Monologues, and now that she has retired from Sesame Street she works to encourage children to read and to help giving them access to books. Thanks to her work, she was awarded the Groundbreaking Latina Lifetime Achievement, and got a Doctor of Fine Arts, an honorary degree given to someone who made significant contribution to society through arts.⁠
