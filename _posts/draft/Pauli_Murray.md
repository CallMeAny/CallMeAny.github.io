Pauli Murray (1910-1985) decided to get a career as civil rights lawyer after she broke the laws of segregation by sitting in a whites-only section in a Virginia bus. She graduated first in her class, but was denied post-graduate work due to her gender. So she changed school, and became the first African American to receive a Doctor of Juridical Science degree from Yale. She wrote the book "States' Laws on Race and Color", which was soon seen as the bible of the civil rights movement. For her entire life she struggled with issues regarding her own sexual identity, holding relationships with women and being nowadays recognized as transgender. When she left academia, he became the first African-american woman to be ordained as Episcopal priest, in the first year that women were ordained by that church.‚Å†
