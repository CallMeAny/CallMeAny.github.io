Yeshe Tsogyal (~8th century) is considered the mother of Tibetan Buddhism. She was born a princess and fled from arranged marriages: she wanted to pursue a life of spiritual practice rather than being a wife. She was married to the emperor of Tibet, who gave her as an offering to an Indian Buddhist master who he had invited to propagate Buddhist teachings. The master freed Yeshe, and she became her main disciple and consort. She wondered if the female body was inferior, and her master advised her that the male or female body is the basis for enlightenment, and a woman's body striving for enlightenment is the better one. Yeshe is an important role model, and through many years of spiritual practices she reached awakening. She is seen as a fully enlightened Buddha.‚Å†
