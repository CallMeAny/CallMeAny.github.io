Black Mambas Anti Poaching Unit is a South African ranger unit, founded in 2013. Their days start with a military-style parade, before orders are issued and the members start their patrols, which happen for 21 days a month. The girls wear ranger uniforms and are trained in tracking and combat, but are unarmed: they aim at protecting the animals by creating a visible police presence. For many girls, coming out of the local communities, this is the first job after high school. At first people were skeptical of them taking over traditionally male jobs, but are now seen as village heroes: the Black Mambas have arrested poachers, taken down multiple camps and reduced snaring (animal traps) by 3/4.‚Å†
