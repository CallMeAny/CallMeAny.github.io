Emmy Noether (1882-1935) is often described as the most important woman in the history of mathematics. As a young girl she did not stand out academically, but she was quick in solving brain teasers, showing a great logical intelligence. As all girls, she was taught to cook and clean, but those were not her passions. At first, she wanted to teach French and English, but instead studied mathematics. When she was invited to join the mathematics department at the University of G√∂ttingen, a really famous center of research, the philosophical faculty objected because she was a woman, and she had to spend years lecturing under another professor's name. During her time, she developed theories that became fundamentals in abstract algebra and theoretical physics.‚Å†
