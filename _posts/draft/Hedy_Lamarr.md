Hedy Lamarr (1914-2000) was an actress, film producer and inventor. She started her acting career in Europe, but her controlling husband made her stop. She secretly fled from him disguising herself as her own maid and heading to Paris and then to London. She then scored a movie contract in Hollywood, where she was promoted as "the world's most beautiful woman." But Hedy disliked being typecasted, so she cofounded a new production studio and starred in its films. Hedy had no formal training, but loved to work in inventions in her spare time: she was the one suggesting aviation tycoon Howard Hughes to make his planes a more streamlined shape, based on the shape of fast birds and fishes. He supported her tinkering and put his team of scientists at her disposal. When WWII started, she helped develop a frequency-hopping signal for radio-controlled torpedoes, so that they could not be tracked or jammed. This invention was not adopted by the US Navy, but still nowadays is part of the workings of Bluetooth communication and legacy WiFi systems.‚Å†
