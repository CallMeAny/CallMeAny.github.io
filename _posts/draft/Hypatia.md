Hypatia (~360-415 AD) was a philosopher, astronomer, and mathematician who lived in Alexandria. She was the first female mathematician, and was renowned in her own lifetime as a great teacher and a wise counselor, beloved by both pagans and Christians. Thanks to her popularity, Hypatia also had great political influence. However, a new bishop in the city started a policy of intolerance against Jews and other minorities that Hypatia didn't support. Therefore the bishop attempted to discredit her and undermine her reputation, until a mob of Christians kidnapped her and murdered her brutally. It is said that this murder was entirely motivated by politics, and her own paganism didn't play a role in that at all.‚Å†
