Dana Scully (fictional) is a medical doctor and FBI agent investigating unsolved cases labeled "X-Files". The cases she works on are mostly related to supernatural or to aliens, and while her partner Fox Mulder is more of a "believer" she tries to stick to what science can prove. In her cases, she often acts as forensic pathologist, performing or consulting on autopsies of victims of the X-File cases.‚Å†
She was brought up Catholic, although her career in science and medicine made her drift away from the church. She couldn't completely get rid of her religious believes, and the cases she worked on kept testing the limits of her faith.‚Å†
The character of Dana Scully is described as one of the most iconic character in the science-ficiton genre: during the serie she was forced to question herself and grow due to circumstances, while showing rationality and resilience to be better than her flaws. The legacy left by the character was huge, inspiring an entire generation of young women to pursue careers in STEM.‚Å†
