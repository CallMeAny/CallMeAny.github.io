Mata Hari (1876-1917) had a happy childhood, but after her dad went bankrupt and her family fell apart she moved to the Dutch East Indies in answer to a marriage advertisement on a newspaper. However, the marriage was a disappointment and she escaped by focusing on studying Indonesian traditions. After divorcing she moved to Paris, where she became famous as an exotic dancer. She portrayed herself as a Javanese princess who studied sacred Indian dances since childhood. The number where she slowly removed all clothing until only wearing a bra and skin-toned stockings was her most acclaimed. During WWI she could cross borders freely, because she was citizen of a neutral country. Therefore France asked her to become a spy, and the idea was for her to seduce a German general and try to get military secrets. However, she was later arrested by the French with the accuse of being a German spy too, even if evidence was lacking: they found secret ink in her room, but she said it was part of her makeup. She did take money from the Germans, but apparently never carried out the spying duties: for the entire trial she said she was innocent, but at the end she was executed by the French.‚Å†
