Joan Jett (1958-) is a rock star who was described as the Queen of Rock 'n' Roll and the Godmother of Punk. When she was 14 she started playing guitar, but soon quit taking lessons because her instructor insisted on teaching her folk songs. Joan Jett & the Blackhearts is the band that she founded in 1979: she placed an ad in the newspaper saying that she was "looking for three good men", and so found her first bass player, guitarist and drummer. While gaining fanbase, she invested personal savings to print copies of their album, and started selling it from the trunk of their cars. The album I Love Rock'n'Roll was the turning point, and from there she moved on with other albums and performances, breaking the record at the time for the fastest ticket sell-out on Broadway.‚Å†
