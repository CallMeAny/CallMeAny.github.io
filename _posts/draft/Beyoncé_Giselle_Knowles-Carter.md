Beyonc√© Giselle Knowles-Carter (1981-) started early in her career, for example at age 7 performing "Imagine" so good that she beat 15-16yo competitors. She became a star in the 90s as lead singer of Destiny's Child, and released her first solo album during a hiatus of the band. While with the band, Beyonc√© experienced severe depression, but she was afraid to speak about it because Destiny's Child had just won a Grammy and therefore she feared that nobody would have taken her seriously. Thanks to her mom she fought the depression, and came back stronger. She continued publishing her music after the band broke up, and her third album won six Grammys and Song of the Year with "Single Ladies". Overall, she won 23 Grammy Awards and 24 MTV Video Music Awards, and in 2014 she became the highest-paid black musician in history. If this was not enough, she also holds an acting career in multiple movies, and appears in many TV shows. ‚Å†
