Mae Jemison (1956-) is an American engineer, physician and astronaut. She was in medical school and later joined the Peace Corps, until she was selected for the NASA astronaut corps. She holds nine honorary doctorates in science, engineering, letters and humanities, and also appeared in an episode of Star Trek. She was the first African American woman to travel in space, aboard of the space shuttle Endeavour. She says that while watching the Apollo when everybody was thrilled about landing on the moon, she was irritated that there were no women astronauts. She decided that enrolling in NASA was an easier way to go to space than just waiting in a field for ET to pick her up.‚Å†
