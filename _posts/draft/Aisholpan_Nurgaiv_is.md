Aisholpan Nurgaiv is a Kazakh girl from Mongolia who wanted to become the first female eagle hunter. She grew interested in that art while taking care of her dad's eagle. She learned how to train the animals from her dad, and after capturing her own eaglet she goes on training it and entering the annual Golden Eagle Festival. She manages to win the competition, and faces the winter hunt that will make her an actual hunter. ⁠
