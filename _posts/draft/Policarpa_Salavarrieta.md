Policarpa Salavarrieta (1795-1817), known as La Pola, was a Colombian seamstress who spied for the revolutionary forces during the Spanish Reconquista of the Viceroyalty of New Granada. This happened because she was living in Guaduas, an important stop on one of the main roads to New Granada: soldiers, insurgents, nobles, farmers and pretty much everybody else passed through Guaduas, making it a center of commerce and of news. However, nobody in Bogot√° knew her as a revolutionary, so when she entered the city with forged documents she could move freely and was able to infiltrate the homes of royalists by offering her seamstress services. In there, she listened to conversations, collected intelligence, and found out who they were suspecting to be revolutionaries. La Pola was also helping soldiers desert the Royal Army and join the Revolution, and transporting weapons, ammunition and supplies to the insurgents. In Colombia she is an heroine, and November 14th is the "day of the Colombian Woman" in honor of the anniversary of her death.‚Å†
