Kate Shelley (1863-1912) is recognized as a US railroad heroine, and is the first woman to have a bridge and even a train named after her. Her story started on a heavy thunderstorm night, which caused a flash flood which in turn washed out some of the timbers supporting the railroad bridge. A locomotive was sent to investigate the damages to the line, but the bridge couldn't support it and it plummeted into the creek with its crew inside. Kate heard the crash, and went out investigating knowing well that there was a passenger's train due to come only a few hours later. She found two of the crewmembers still living, and went to search for help. Her lantern went soon out, and she had to crawl across the leftovers of the bridge with just lightnings to show her way. She run two miles before finding a depot where she could run the alarm, and then led a rescue party back to the incident. Thanks to her action, two of the crewmembers were saved, and the passenger's train with 200 on board was stopped in time.‚Å†
