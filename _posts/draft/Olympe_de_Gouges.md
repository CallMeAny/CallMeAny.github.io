Olympe de Gouges (1748-1793) was a French playwright, political activist and feminist active during the revolution. Born in southwest France, she moved to Paris after her husband died: she started a relationship with a wealthy man, but refused his marriage proposal defining marriage as "the tomb of trust and love". She established a theater company and attended philosophical and artistic salons. With her writings and plays she took a stand against slavery, for which she became the target of threats. Many moved against her and her success, and she ended up taking legal action: she was determined to be successful, in spite of her enemies. She greeted the revolution with hope, but quickly become disenchanted when the equality was not extended to women. In response to the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, she wrote the Declaration of the Rights of Woman and of the Female Citizen, and a Social Contract named after the work of Rousseau. She fought for the right of women to gain active citizenship, and to express their opinions and vote. She was against violent revolution and supported constitutional monarchy, to the point of writing in defense of the king and against capital punishment: this enraged many republicans and deputes, and her writings becoming more strong got her arrested. It was in fact against the law to publish anything that encouraged the monarchy, and she was even writing a piece in which the queen tried to save the monarchy. Even though in the piece there was Gouges herself scolding the queen, she was judged for creating a character that could inspire sympathies. She was denied a lawyer on the base that she could defend herself, and she got sentenced to death for seditious behavior and attempting to reinstate the monarchy.‚Å†
