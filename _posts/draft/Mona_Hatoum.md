Mona Hatoum (1952-) is a Palestinian born and grown in Lebanon, where she studied graphic design. Already as a kid she liked drawing and illustration, although her family did not support her desire to pursue art. The Lebanese Civil War broke out while Mona was visiting London, and she was forced into exile, so she stayed in the UK. Her art "explores human struggles related to political conflict, global inequity and being an outsider", and her works try to get a physical response that provokes emotional reactions: Mona's early works were mostly performance pieces in which she directly confronted the audience. Her work evolved, and she abandoned performances as too politically direct, and started focusing on installations and object, with her art starting to ask questions rather than making statements. For example, in her work Keffieh she presents a scarf woven of human hair, bringing up questions about the ideas of femininity and religion.‚Å†
