Gracia Mendes Nasi (1510-1569) was one of the wealthiest Jew women in the European Renaissance. Her family, originally from Aragon in Spain, had fled to Portugal so that they could still practice Judaism in the wake of forced conversions. However, a few years later they also became Conversos when all Jews of Portugal were forcibly converted to Catholicism. Gracia married a very rich black pepper trader, in both a public catholic wedding and a secret crypto-judaic (the hidden adherence to Judaism while professing another religion) ceremony. Her husband died a few years later, leaving part of his fortune to her. In the wake of a Portuguese Inquisition, she moved to Antwerp where there was a branch office of their house, and there started investing her money and making a name for herself as businneswoman. Many tried to separate her from her wealth, by arranging a marriage for her daughter: if that happened, the fortune would have fallen under control of the daughter's husband. Gracia resisted all these attempts, and used her fortune to influence kings and popes. She tried to postpone the Inquisition, she protected fellow Conversos and financed an escape network: Jews from Spain and Portugal were loaded in her spice ships, and upon reaching Antwerp they were given means to head to Venice and then to the Ottoman Empire that at the time welcome Jews.‚Å†
