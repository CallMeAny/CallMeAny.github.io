Violeta Parra (1917-1967) is known as the mother of Latin American folk. She learned playing guitar from her mother, who also taught her traditional folk songs: soon she started writing her own songs, together with her siblings. When starting her professional career, Violeta used to sing songs of Spanish origin. But after a few years she went back to folk, and started collecting and collating songs from all over the country. She learned how to play the guitarron, a traditional Chilean guitar with 25 strings, and she was soon asked to do recitals at universities, and had her own very successful radio program. ⁠
