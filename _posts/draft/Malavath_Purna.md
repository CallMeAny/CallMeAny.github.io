Malavath Purna (2000-) is born in the Telangana state of India. At her school, mostly for poor students, her talent and physical condition were spotted and she was selected for climbing Mount Everest. Her expedition needed 52 days to get to the top, but when they managed, at 13 years and 11 months she became the youngest girl to have ever reached the summit.‚Å†
