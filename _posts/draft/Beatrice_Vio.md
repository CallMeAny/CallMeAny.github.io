Beatrice Vio (1997-) is a wheelchair fencer, who won twice the European championship, twice the World championship and the gold medal in the 2016 Paralympics in the foil B category. She was also in the 2012 Paralympics: she was too young as an athlete to participate, but was picked as torchbearer for the opening ceremony. Her disability was caused by an infection due to meningitis, for which she got amputations of both legs from the knee, and both arms from the forearms. This event made her a fierce supporter for early vaccinations. However, the surgeries didn't stop her, and after only a few months of recovery and rehabilitation she was back doing sport.‚Å†
