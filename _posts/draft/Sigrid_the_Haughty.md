Sigrid the Haughty (legend) was the daughter of a powerful Swedish nobleman, and held many great estates. Two kings sought to marry her, but she burned them to death to discourage other suitors. Later the king of Norway asked for her hand, but also asked her to convert to Christianity. She said that the was not going to part from the faith of her family and ancestors, answer that the king didn't like at all. He slapped her with a glove, act that made Sigrid decide to work for his downfall. She allied Sweden with Denmark, leading to the Battle of Swold, in which King Olaf of Norway fell. These stories come from Norse sagas, and it is unclear how much historical sources went into making these stories. Modern interpretations assume that the life and acts of multiple women were collected and merged to create the figure of powerful, revengeful Sigrid.‚Å†
