Rupi Kaur (1992-) comes from a Sikh family that emigrated to Canada from Punjab. Her mom inspired her to draw and paint, and at university she studied rhetoric and professional writing. Until 2013 she was sharing her work anonymously, but in 2013 she started a Tumblr and then on 2014 her Instagram, where she also illustrated her writings. Her work commonly touches topics like rape, abuse, femininity, love, self-care, and heartbreak. She writes exclusively in lower case and using only periods as punctuation, to honor her culture. Her first book, Milk and Honey, sold over 2.5 million copies and spent more than a year on the New York Times best seller list.⁠
