Florence Bascom (1862-1945) was born in a family that supported the women's right to get a college education and enter into society. She earned two bachelor's degrees in arts and science, and then moved on to get a master's degree and later a PhD in geology, this one at Johns Hopkins University, becoming the first female to earn a degree at that institution.‚Å†
She became instructor and associate professor, and founded the geology department of Bryn Mawr College, which later became one of the best departments in the US. Florence was appointed assistant of the US Geological Survey and was assigned a terrain to study, which she observed and mapped over summer and winter. She contributed to a special type of identification for acidic volcanoes, and drew notable conclusions regarding the cycles of erosion in Pennsylvania.‚Å†
Florence's legacy is due of course to her significant scientific discoveries, but also to her work in training women geologists.‚Å†
