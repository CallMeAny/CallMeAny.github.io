Tamika Flynn (fictional, voiced by Symphony Sanders) is a resident of Night Vale, and is first introduced as an avid reader and as a fearless leader when after being abducted to participate in the banned Summer Reading Program, she survived the ordeal and reappeared leading all the kids after having defeated the evil librarians. She goes on to start the resistance against the monopoly of StrexCorp by organizing and leading a local militia. After StrexCorp started hunting her down she managed to stay at large for more than a year, taking down helicopters that were looking for her. After being captured, she managed to escape and rejoined the resistance. She is seen as a hero in Night Vale, but she also said that "Sad is not the land that has no hero. Sad is the land that needs a hero.".⁠
