Anaïs Nin (1903-1977) has been writing for most of her life: she kept journals from her teenage years until her death, and she is famous for being a writer of female erotica. She discovered the gender by reading the books of the owner of a house her family rented, and started writing for a collector because she needed the money. Before her, there was almost no acknowledgment at all of erotica written by ladies.⁠
