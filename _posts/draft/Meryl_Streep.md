Meryl Streep (1949-) is often described as the best actress of her generation. She grew up being encouraged by her mother to follow her dreams, to put her mind to something and not be lazy in pursuing it. As early as 12 Meryl realized she enjoyed performing in front of a camera, and got opera lessons for singing at a school recital. However she realized that she wasn't feeling that art, so she didn't pursue the singing career. During a representation at college she gained attention across the entire campus for her natural way of acting, and for the ease with which she could mimic accents and pick up her lines. The pic was taken when she was leading home after being refused a part in King Kong because she was too "ugly". Her answer to that critique was '[...] you're just one opinion in a sea of thousands and I'm off to find a kinder tide.' She went on to be nominated for a record 21 Academy Awards winning 3, and a record 32 Golden Globe nominations and winning 8.‚Å†
