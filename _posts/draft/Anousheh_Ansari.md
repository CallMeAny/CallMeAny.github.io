Anousheh Ansari (1966-) was born in Iran, and witnessed the revolution shortly before emigrating to the United States. After getting a degree in electrical engineering, together with her husband she founded Telecom Technologies Inc, supplying software-implemented switching technology that enabled telcom services to integrate existing networks to next-generation networks. Anousheh supports the privatization of space, the concept for which commercial companies could send equipment or people to space independently from a government, for exploration or other purposes. Through Space Adventures, Ltd. Anousheh has trained as a backup for another astronaut, and upon his medical disqualification she could join the Soyuz TMA-9 mission, joining the prime crew. With this event, she became the first female space tourist, and on her 9 day stay on the ISS she performed various space experiments for the European Space Agency. With her flight, she hoped to inspire everyone worldwide, but in particular young people and girls in the Middle Eastern countries to not give up on their dreams and pursue them looking for opportunities to make them happen. While some crewmates at the time expressed concern over space tourists, one of the opinions was also that the economical support they gave to the Russian space program was as vital for the US space program, which relies heavily on the Soyuz.‚Å†
Interestingly, Anousheh said that she does not consider herself a "space tourist" but prefers the title of "spaceflight participant"‚Å†
