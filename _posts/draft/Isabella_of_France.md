Isabella of France (~1295-1358) arrived in England aged 12 as wife of King Edward II. She supported her husband in these first years, and used her relationship with the French monarchy to develop her own authority and power. During a diplomatic mission in France, Isabella decided to depose Edward, and returned to England with a mercenary army: the king's forces deserted him, and she became queen regent on behalf of her son. She was known for her diplomatic skills and intelligence, although she was often portrayed as cruel and manipulative. During her reign she resolved long-running problems like the wars with Scotland, but these actions were unpopular, and together with her lavish spending contributed to make her reign crumbling in favor of her son who assessed his authority. Her actions made her be remembered as "femme fatale" in many plays and literature over the years.‚Å†
