Miki Endo (1986-2011) was employed by the Crisis Management Department of her town in Japan to broadcast disaster advisories and warning. She was recognized as heroine for sacrificing her life during the 2011 earthquake and tsunami: while many fled to the roof of the building, she remained at her post continuing to broadcast warnings and alerts over the community loudspeakers that were being silenced by the upcoming tsunami. The building in which she was working was completely gutted, and of the 40 people that were on the roof, only 11 survived by clinging to the antenna.‚Å†
