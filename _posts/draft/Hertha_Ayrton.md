Hertha Ayrton (1854-1923) was a British inventor, engineer and suffragette. She had to start caring for her siblings when still really young, as her father died and her mom was left pregnant and taking care of her and her six siblings. She got an education thanks to her aunt who run a school. She was working as governess, but also studied in Cambridge, where she was involved in multiple activities: she built a sphygmomanometer, led the choral society and formed a mathematical club, and founded the Girton fire brigade. At Cambridge she didn't get a degree because at the time only certificates were handed out to women, but she later got a Bachelor of Science at University of London. During all her life she went on studying and at the same time funding herself with jobs like teaching and embroidering, while caring for her disabled sister. She patented multiple inventions, but her most known work is about the electrical arc: she was the first woman admitted at the Institution of Electrical Engineers, and she was to read her work in front of the Royal Society but wasn't allowed due to her sex (a man read it in her stand). However, just a few years later, she was the first woman to be awarded the Hughes Medal from the Society itself. It is thanks to her success that the British Association for the Advancement of Science started to allow women to serve on committees.‚Å†
