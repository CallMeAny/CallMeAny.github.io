Olympias (~375-316 bc) became the queen consort of Macedonia when she married kind Philip II. The marriage was tumultuous, and saw Olympias going into voluntary exile and later being suspected of the assassination of the king by hand of his personal bodyguard. With this death and the execution of the second wife of the king and her spawn, Olympias ensured the throne of Macedonia for her son, Alexander the Great. Alexander tried to keep her away from politics, but during his campaigns her influence was great both in Macedonia and Epirus, where she even served as regent. After Alexander's death in Babylon, the succession to the Macedonian throne was unsure and swinging with weddings being made and broken: Olympias realized the crown rightfully owned by her grandson was in danger, so she collected the Macedonian army, who supported her, and invaded Macedonia to restore her power. She was successful at first, but the king at the time managed to capture her and condemned her to be executed. However, the soldiers refused: after all, she was the mother of the legendary Alexander the Great. In the end, she had to be stoned to death by the families of her many victims.‚Å†
