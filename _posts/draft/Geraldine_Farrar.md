Geraldine Farrar (1882-1967) started studying music at age 5, and was giving recitals by age 14. Her soprano voice made her a sensation in all the opera companies in which she worked, and she developed a great following, in particular among New York's young female opera goers. Similar to most fanbases nowadays, even those girls had a name: they were known as Gerry-Flappers. Geraldine also acted in a dozen silent films, produced between opera seasons, and her acting skills were highly praised. Contrary to what other opera singers did, Geraldine never sacrificed dramatic action for tonal perfection, and therefore managed to achieve highly emotional performances in her roles. She was awarded two stars in the Hollywood Walk of Fame.‚Å†
