Adele Goldberg (1945-) is a Jewish computer scientist who grew up in Chicago. She was part of the developers who came up with the programming language Smalltalk, from which the object-oriented programming approach and the concept of graphical user interface developed. Also she came up with design patterns that are still widely used in software architecture. Her ideas were used by Steve Jobs as a basis for the Macintosh environment.‚Å†
