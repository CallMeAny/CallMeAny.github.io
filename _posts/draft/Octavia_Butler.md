Octavia Butler (1947-2006) was a really shy kid, and she liked going at the library to read fantasy. She had slight dyslexia, but she always used to write, starting at age 10 on a big Remington typewriter. She grew up in Pasadena, which was racially integrated, so she could experience cultural and ethnic diversity while elsewhere racial segregation was ongoing. During college she participated in workshops, one of them especially focused on science fiction, which became her genre of choice. By the late 1970s she already had enough success to become a full-time writer, and additionally she run her own workshops. She won the Hugo Award with a novel about a post-pandemic world that left humans barely able to communicate with each other, and the Nebula Award with a story of the United States under the grip of Christian fundamentalism, where new religion is encouraging men to leave Earth. These two are the most important prizes for science fiction writers worldwide.‚Å†
