Fabiola Gianotti (1960-) is the first woman to be Director-General at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research), and the first ever Director-General to be appointed for a second term. As a kid she was always encouraged to follow her curiosity, and she became interested in scientific research after reading a biography of Marie Curie. After classical studies, she moved to get a PhD in experimental particle physics, and she started her career at CERN with a fellowship, going on to become a full time research physicist. She was involved in multiple experiments, participating in detector development, software development and data analysis, and among her achievements she got a lot of credits for the discovery of the Higgs boson. In her position, she aims at giving support to women especially for the choice of maternity, and she speaks for science and religion to be two separate spheres: "You can be a physicist and have faith or not."‚Å†
