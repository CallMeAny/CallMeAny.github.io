Ashley Fiolek (1990-) is a former professional motocross racer and a stunt actor. She was born deaf, and in eight grade her parents decided to homeschool her: they spent long periods in her grandfather's cabin, riding through the woods for hours on the Yamaha PW50 that she got when she was around three years old.‚Å†
She began racing at age seven, and went on starting her professional wins becoming the 2008 WMX Pro National champion. With a few injuries, broken bones and concussions that forced her to take time off to heal, she continued her successful career until 2013. During that time, she became the first female motocross racer to make the cover of TransWorld Motocross magazine, and the first woman to be signed to the American Honda Racing factory team. She also appeared on a RedBull commercial, and was featured on an issue of Vogue.‚Å†
After leaving her racing career, she began working as a motorcycle stunt performer for a Marvel Universe Live show.‚Å†
