Sigrid Undset (1882-1949) had to give up the hopes of studying at university when her dad died and to help her family she had to work as a secretary. While doing her office work she also started to write, but her first novel wasn't accepted to be published. She didn't give up and tried a few years later with a more contemporary story that scandalized the readers: the first sentence of the book was "I have been unfaithful to my husband". She lived in a time of emancipation and wrote of women and immoral loves, but she felt like living in a time of moral and ethical decline, while WWI was approaching and going to leave Europe devastated. It is after the war that she wrote her masterpiece: following the life and experiences of a woman, she describes life in Norway in the Middle Ages, in a trilogy that will become her most famous work. Thanks to her career she was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1928.‚Å†
