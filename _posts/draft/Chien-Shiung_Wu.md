Chien-Shiung Wu (1912-1997) was a Chinese-American experimental physicist, specialized in nuclear physics. She worked for the Manhattan Project, the research that led to creating the first nuclear weapons, and helped develop the process to separate uranium in its isotopes. She went to school in China, always ending up in the top students of her courses, and moved in the US to pursue her PhD. She graduated, but ended up in an academic job that only required teaching and didn't leave time for research. She wasn't happy with that, and moved on to become an instructor for naval officers. It is there that she started supporting the Manhattan Project, but even though for the general public this is her most known work, she also run experiments about parity (an element of quantum mechanics), showing results that allowed the two colleagues who came up with the parity-nonconservation hypothesis to win the Nobel Prize. Chien-Shiung herself was honored a few years later with the Wolf Prize.‚Å†
