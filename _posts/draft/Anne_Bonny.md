Anne Bonny (~1697-~1782) was an Irish pirate navigating in the Caribbean. She moved from Ireland to London to Carolina, and finally to Nassau after getting married. While in London, her father started dressing her as a boy educating her to be a lawyer's clerk, but after disapproving her marriage he disowned her. In Nassau, Anne didn't like her husband telling the governor about pirates, and after falling in love with John Rackham she took the sea with him, disguised as a man. Nobody apart from Rackham knew she was a lady, and while working and fighting alongside the men she showed her competence and effectiveness, gaining respect from all the shipmates. When caught, Anne avoided being hung because she was pregnant: she was kept imprisoned until she gave birth, but there is no official record of her release, execution, or death. Rumors say she managed to escape and continue her life as a pirate. ‚Å†
