Grazia Deledda (1871-1936) started her writing career being published by a fashion magazine, which at the time accepted also poetry and prose. She was inspired by the struggles of peasant life in her native Sardinia, and she combined imaginary and autobiographical elements. However, she did not criticize the people victim of the circumstances, and instead pointed the finger against social values and moral norms. When she received the Nobel for Literature, her first comment was "Already?!". She liked to keep a strict schedule on her days: she started with a late breakfast, then a few hours of reading, lunch followed by a nap and finally ending the day with a few hours of writing. Even if she lived in a time of emancipation, she did not gain much recognition as a feminist, probably due to her depiction of women's suffering rather than of their autonomy.‚Å†
