Mary Fields (~1832‚Äì1914) was born a slave in Tennessee, and was freed when slavery became illegal. She spent some years working at a convent doing housekeeping works. She was ordered to leave after several complaints, and both Natives and locals didn't know what to make of her, saying that she acted like a white woman but had a black skin. After leaving the convent she opened a restaurant, and gave food to anyone without caring if they could pay. The restaurant went bankrupt a few months later. At the time the postal service awarded internal routes to the lowest qualified bidders: at age 63, Mary got hired because she was the fastest applicant to hitch a team of six horses. She became the first African American woman to work for the U.S. Postal Service, and for her reliability she was nicknamed "Stagecoach": she never missed a day, and if there was snow to deep for horses and mules, she delivered the mail on snowshoes, carrying the sacks on her shoulders.‚Å†
