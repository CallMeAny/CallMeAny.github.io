Gertrude Elion (1918-1999) shared the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1988 thanks to her work for rational drug design: instead of discovering new drugs by trial and error, rational design is based on understanding the biochemical properties of the target to come up with a dedicated product. She was inspired to become a scientist after witnessing her grandfather suffering of stomach cancer, and could attend college for free thanks to her great grades. However after graduating she couldn't find a paying research job because of her gender, and had to work as a secretary and teacher before finding an unpaid position in a chemistry lab. This problem kept her from obtaining interesting jobs for most of her career, but finally she managed to get hired as an assistant to Mr. Hitchings in a pharmaceutical company. That's where her work was the most successful: thanks to her efforts that AZT, one of the first effective AIDS drugs, was developed; she synthesized anti-cancer drugs and created an immunosupressive drug used to fight rejection in organ transplants.‚Å†
