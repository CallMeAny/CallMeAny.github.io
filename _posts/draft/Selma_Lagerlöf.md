Selma Lagerl√∂f (1858-1940) was the first woman to win the Nobel Prize for Literature, and the first woman to be granted a membership in the Swedish Academy, and later became the first woman to be depicted on a Swedish banknote. Since she was a child she loved reading, and grew up with her grandmother telling her stories of fairy tales and fantasy. As the schooling system in her area wasn't fully developed at the time, she got schooled at home, and soon decided that she would be a writer when she grew up and she started writing poetry, although she didn't publish anything until later in life. She started to work as a teacher, but the success of her books allowed her to focus on writing: inspired by her trips she wrote some more and got great success, to the point of being compared to Shakespeare and Homer. Selma had close relationships with two women, who supported and criticized her work, although there were strong rivalry issues. Because homosexual relations were taboo and illegal in Sweden at the time, and because the language boundaries between expressions of friendship and love were quite vague, the things that can be said of those relationships are that they were close, emotional and exclusive. The Nobel Prize was awarded to her in appreciation of her idealism, vivid imagination and spiritual perception, and the money allowed her to buy back her father's estate in which she lived for the rest of her life. At the start of WWII, she sent her Nobel Prize medal and gold medal from the Swedish Academy to Finalnd to help raise money to fight the Soviet Union: the Finnish government was so touched that it raised the necessary money by other means and returned the medals to her.‚Å†
