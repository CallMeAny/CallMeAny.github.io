Mary Blair (1911-1978) got her first job as an animator for Metro Goldwyn Mayer, but soon moved over to Disney: she worked on art for Dumbo, Lady and the Tramp and other works. She joined Walt Disney in a research tour of South America, and her watercolors impressed Walt so much that he appointed her art supervisor for two animated films. She worked on color styling for big movies like Cinderella, Alice in Wonderland and Peter Pan, where her concepts and ideas have a strong influence on the end result. She then worked as freelancer, until Walt asked her to put her talent and innate color styling into developing pavilions for the New York World Fair in 1964. Her work was then moved to Disneyland and replicated in multiple parks. ‚Å†
