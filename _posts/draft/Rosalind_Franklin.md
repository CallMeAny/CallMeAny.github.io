Rosalind Franklin (1920-1958) was a chemist and X-ray crystallographer. Her work was central to the understanding of the molecular structures of, among others, DNA and RNA. Although she has always been really good at school and she even enjoyed doing arithmetic for pleasure, she was so bad in musical education that her teacher inquired on whether she had some hearing disease. This didn't stop her from having an air of cool superiority, and her habit of intensely looking people in the eye while being concise, impatient and direct unnerved many of her colleagues. Her skills in manipulating the specimens and the scientific techniques allowed her to hypothesize that DNA has a helical structure. However this was ahead of its time: the work she did on coal and viruses was appreciated in her lifetime, but her contributions regarding DNA were mostly recognized only after her death.‚Å†
