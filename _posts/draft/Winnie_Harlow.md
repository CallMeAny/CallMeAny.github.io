Winnie Harlow (1994-) was a contestant on America's Next Top Model, and gained prominence because of her skin condition, vitiligo. She was diagnosed at age 4, and due to the discolorated patches on her skin she was victim of bullies calling her names. This forced her to change school multiple times, drop out of high school and even considering suicide. She was discovered on Instagram and invited to America's Next Top Model, from which she was quickly eliminated but then voted back by the audience. After leaving the competition again she became a brand representative for Desigual, and successively for many other brands, magazines and music videos, and participating in events like the London Fashion Week.‚Å†
