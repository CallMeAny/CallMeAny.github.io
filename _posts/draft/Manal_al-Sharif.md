Manal al-Sharif (1979-) is a Saudi Arabian activist who helped start a women's right to drive campaign in 2011. Her position was that women should learn to drive, at least to be able to intervene in case of an emergency. A video of Manal driving was posted online, and this caused her to be arrested, released and rearrested, and her video being rendered inaccessible. However, at that point it was seen by about 600,000 people. After being released from prison, she started another campaign to release women that were kept in prison after their terms were over because they could not pay their debts. She used to share her opinions on her twitter account, but she closed it in 2019 saying that the Saudi authorities used the same platforms in ways she could not agree with.‚Å†
