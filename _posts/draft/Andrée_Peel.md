Andr√©e Peel (1905-2010) joined the French resistance after Germany invaded in WWII. At first she was distributing secret newspapers, but she then moved on to improvising landing strips and using torches to guide allied planes to them. She helped airmen who landed in France to escape onto submarines and gunboats, and aided at least one hundred soldiers and more than 20000 people. In 1944 she was arrested and sent to concentration camp, and survived until the camp was liberated by the US Army.‚Å†
