Gouyen (1857-1903) was a woman of the Chihenne band of Chiricahua Apache. She entered the legend thanks to her actions to avenge the death of her first husband in a Comance raid: after tracking the Comanche camp, she saw the chief in a victory dance, wearing her husband's scalp at the belt. She entered the dancing circle camouflaged with a ceremony dress, and seduced the drunken chief. When he followed her in a more private place she stabbed him to death and took his scalp. She then stole a horse and rode back to her camp, presenting the evidence of her successful revenge.‚Å†
