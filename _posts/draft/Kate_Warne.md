Kate Warne (1833-1868) was the first female detective in the Pinkerton agency and in the US. In the Pinkerton agency they thought she was looking for a secretary job, but she argued that a woman detective could do useful work that would be impossible for men, for example by befriending relatives of the suspects. She worked undercover, and she helped in a case regarding an assassination attempt to presidential candidate Lincoln. She was so successful that Pinkerton made her the head of the Female Detective Bureau.‚Å†
