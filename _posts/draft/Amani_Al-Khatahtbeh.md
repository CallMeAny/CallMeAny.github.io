Amani Al-Khatahtbeh (1992-) grew up in the US, but her family decided to move to Jordan because of the increasing violence against Muslims in the US. They moved back after her mom fell ill, to be closer to the family, and she decided to wear the hijab as an act of resistance against Islamophobia. She founded MuslimGirl.com in 2009 to create a community for young Muslim women, and the site got 1.7 million clicks in 2018.⁠
