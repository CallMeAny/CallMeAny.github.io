Bessie Coleman (1892-1926) had to work in cotton fields as a kid, and attended a segregated school. Her dream was to fly, but there were no opportunities for her in the US: training opportunities were dedicated to white men. So she saved money, and obtained a sponsorship to go to France and attend flight school. She went back to the US as a high profile pilot, taking part to dangerous air shows, where she was known as Queen Bess and Brave Bessie. She was the first African-American and Native-American woman to obtain a pilot license, and the first black person to get an international one. She hoped to create a flying school for black people, but died in an accident while testing an aircraft.‚Å†
