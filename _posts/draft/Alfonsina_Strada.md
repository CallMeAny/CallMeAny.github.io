Alfonsina Strada (1891-1959) took part in the cycling competition Giro d'Italia in 1924. The organizer was offering places to whoever wanted to take part, so she just registered omitting the last letter of her name and everybody just assumed she was a man. They discovered the truth when it was too late, so she started the race, finishing middle of the pack in the first few days. Then the weather worsened, and after a crash she managed to finish the day but behind the time limit. She was therefore excluded from the competition, but due to public support she was allowed to continue individually. She reached the end of the tour in triumph, with more than 20 hours of advantage on the last man competing.‚Å†
