Peggy Guggenheim (1898-1979) was a socialite and art collector. She fell in love with the bohemian artistic community while working in an avant-garde bookstore in New York, and when she later moved to Paris she got involved in the avant-garde community, befriending numerous writers and artists. With the money that she inherited from her father (the equivalent of about 40 millions), she opened a gallery for modern art in London, called Guggenheim Jeune, and began collecting works of art: she had a habit of purchasing at least one object from each of the exhibitions at her gallery. However, the gallery wasn't profitable, so she decided to create a museum for contemporary arts: she went to Paris to negotiate loans for artworks for the first exhibition, but WWII made her change plans and she ended up instead buying the works. Just a few days before the Germans reached Paris, she fled to Southern France together with her collection, and from there to New York, where she opened a new gallery. After the war and a divorce, she moved to Venice, where she continued collecting and promoting art until the 60s: at that point, she started focusing on presenting what she already owned, making the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Palazzo Venier dei Leoni the most important museum in Italy for European and American art.‚Å†
