Laura Bassi (1711-1778) was an Italian woman who got a doctoral degree in Philosophy from the University of Bologna. She earned a professorship in philosophy and later in physics, and she is recognized as the first woman in the world to be appointed a chair in a scientific field. She only lectured from home as the university believed that women were to lead a private life. However she was interested in Newtonian science, and produced a lot of dissertations.‚Å†
