Freydis Eiriksdottir (~970, legend) is a strong-willed woman appearing in both of the Vinland sagas, Icelandic texts written in the 13th century to describes events occurred around the year 1000, when the Norse people discovered and explored North America, known as "Wineland" for the presence of grapevines. The most detailed tale of Freydis portrays her as a woman that wanted the prestige and wealth associated with a Vinland journey. She organized the trip with two other men, and got permission to use the homes that her own brother had already build in Vinland. Once there, claiming she was beaten by the two men that organized the trip with her, she forced her husband to take revenge by assassinating them and their men in their sleep, and when the husband refused to kill the women, Freydis herself took an axe and massacred them. While upon returning to Greenland the word of what she had done was spreading, she kept threatening everybody who brought up the topic, and even her own brother couldn't bring himself to punish her.‚Å†
A second different tale says instead that Freydis, part of a Vinland expedition while eight months pregnant, witnessed how the Nordic men panicked and tried to flee when the natives attacked their camp with catapults. She yelled at the men accusing them of being cowards, but nobody listened to her. So she picked up a sword and engaged the natives, which quickly surrounded her. That's when Freydis undid her garment and started beating the sword upon her breast, at which point the natives retreated and fled. For this gesture, Freydis was praised by all of the survivors.‚Å†
Freydis is also one of the pivot characters of the recent novel Civilizations by Laurent Binet, in which her reach of South America starts a technological development that will result in the Incas colonizing Europe.‚Å†
