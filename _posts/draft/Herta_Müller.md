Herta M√ºller (1953-) is born in Romania, and is part of the German minority living there. She is a Nobel-winning author, with her work telling of violence, cruelty and terror often in the setting of the repressive regime in the Socialist Republic of Romania that the experienced herself. Her grandfather was a wealthy farmer, but his property was confiscated by the Communist regime. During WWII her father was part of the Waffen SS, and her mother was deported to forced labor camps in the Soviet Union. With this family history, in 1979 Herta was working as a translator for an engineering factory, but was dismissed for refusing to cooperate with the Securitate, the Communist regime's secret police. She started writing short after, and her first book as published in a state-censored version. In 2009 she published The Hunger Angel, telling the story of a man journeying to a gulag in Soviet Union. It is said that her Nobel win was in recognition of an author who refuses to let the inhumane side of life under communism be forgotten.‚Å†
