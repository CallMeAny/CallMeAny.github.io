Gerty Cori (1896-1957) wanted to be a medical doctor, but her home education left her lacking in latin, physics, chemistry, and math. That didn't stop her, and over a year she managed studied all what was missing in her knowledge. She became a pediatrician, but WWI came and food shortage and antisemitism (she was from a Polish Jewish family) made her and her husband Carl decide to leave Europe. In the US they pursued medical research, although the couple was discouraged to work together as that was perceived as "unamerican". They didn't care and went on working together, and they discovered the cycle describing how the human body uses chemical reactions to break some carbohydrates in muscle tissue into lactic acid, while synthesizing others. This research gave them the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1947: she was the first woman to get the prize in that category, and only the third woman to win a Nobel in science.‚Å†
