Masako H≈çj≈ç (1156-1225) came from a family related to the Japanese imperial family, but the clan decided to stay out of the rebellion about who was to be the next emperor. Masako was the oldest of fifteen siblings, and was instructed in horseriding, hunting and fishing. She also ate with the men, rather than with the women of the household as it was custom. Thanks to her husband's position, she took part in the government administration and became a representation of men of the H≈çj≈ç clan. When the H≈çj≈ç clan won the war and all of the opponent clan was eliminated, Masako's husband was named shogun by the emperor, who died later the same year. This made the man the most powerful man in Japan, and with him also his wife and clan. Masako got the power when her husband died and her son became shogun: the son was still young, so Masako, that in the meantime became a Buddhist nun, created a council of regents in which she held a lot of power. When her first son died assassinated, her second son took the charge, but he was still an infant: Masako became the de-facto shogun, and she went on consolidating their power managing relationships and connections between the imperial and aristocratic families, and administering justice and postwar rewards. She is the representation of an era that acknowledged the authority and legitimacy of women in ruling positions.‚Å†
