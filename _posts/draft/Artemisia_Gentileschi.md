Artemisia Gentileschi (1593‚Äì1656) is considered to be one of the most accomplished painters after the death of Caravaggio. She learnt the art of painting, drawing and color mixing at her dad's atelier, where she showed much more talent than her brothers. She did not kneel to the envy everybody showed for her talent, and developed a style that focused on showing strong and suffering women from myths, drawing them with mastery and knowledge. She was the victim of a rape from her tutor, who was also a family friend, but she didn't let this stop her, and the event probably channeled her energy in portraying strong and powerful women, with nothing to fear in comparison of male characters that were usual subjects of her contemporary art.‚Å†
