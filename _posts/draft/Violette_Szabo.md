Violette Szabo (1921-1945) was a British/French Special Operations Executive during WWII. She grew up as a very athletic girl, often deemed tomboyish especially after her father taught her to shoot and she discovered she was very accurate. When war reached Britain, Violette was bored of her daily life, so she enlisted in the Auxiliary Territorial Service and was sent as a predictor on anti-aircraft batteries. She had married a French soldier, who was killed in action: this made Violette accept an offer to train as field agent, her best way to fight the enemy who privated her from her husband. She was trained in multiple fields, from navigation to weaponry, to demolition to communication and cryptography, and she was enlisted in the Field Aid Nursing Yeomanry, an all-women charity active in both nursing and intelligence work. Her first mission had her travel to occupied parts of France to assess how compromised an intelligence circuit already deployed was by German arrests. On her second mission she was supposed to coordinate local maquis (French guerrilla soldiers) in sabotaging communications while Germans tried to stem the Normandy landings. However she was dispatched to join them with a car, that civilians were forbidden to use. This rose German suspicion, and she was arrested at a roadblock, after putting up a gunfight: she was sent to a detention camp, and eventually executed there.‚Å†
