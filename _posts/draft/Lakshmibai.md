Lakshmibai (1828-1858) was the queen of Jhansi in North India. She was married to the Maharaja, but got destituted upon his death when the British East India Company applied its annexation policy. In the same period the Indian Rebellion started, but she was reluctant to rebel against the British. Instead, she took the administration of the city in her hands after rebels of the Bengali infantry seized the fort containing the treasure and magazine, and massacred the British. She kept the city at peace for a few months, until British forces arrived to regain control. At that point they found the city well defended, and Lakshmibai proclaimed that they would fight for independence. After bombardment, the city was taken by the British, and although they had to fight to gain every street and every house, they forced the queen to flee, with her son strapped on her back. She joined other rebels, but their forces were again defeated. She didn't give up fighting and went on ding in battle. With her courage and her acts, she became a symbol of resistance to the British Raj.‚Å†
