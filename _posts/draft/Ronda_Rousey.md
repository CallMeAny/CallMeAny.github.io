Ronda Rousey (1987-) started her mixed martial arts career after being the first American woman to win a medal in Judo in the Olympic Games. Ronda won her MMA debut in a King of the Cage match, and then took part in and won the first women's fight in UFC history. In 2018 Ronda started a career in professional wrestling, and could defend her title as Raw Women's Champion for 231 days, the second-longest reign. Ronda is the only woman to win a championship in both the UFC and WWE, as well as the only woman to headline a pay-per-view event in both companies. Fans voted her best female athlete of all times in a 2015 ESPN poll. Ronda was also an actress during most of her sport career, taking up roles in The Expendables 3, Furious 7 and Mile 22.⁠
