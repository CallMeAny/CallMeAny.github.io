Frances E. Allen (1932-) started her career as a math teacher, but joined IBM to teach Fortran to newcoming employees trying to repay her student loans. Her plan was to return to teaching when the debts were extinguished, but instead she stayed and worked on developing the Alpha programming language, and gave a huge contribution on developing optimizations for compilers, working on concepts like abstractions, algorithms and implementation approaches. She was honored with the Turing Award, the Nobel-equivalent in the computers field, and was the first woman to ever win that prize.‚Å†
