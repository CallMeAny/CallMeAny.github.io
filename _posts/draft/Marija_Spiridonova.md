Marija Spiridonova (1884-1941) was one of the two women playing a relevant role in the Russian revolution. In 1906 she joined a combat group of revolutionaries, and assassinated a security official who had repressed in blood workers' strikes the previous year. For this she was tortured and sentenced to death, but instead became a laborer in Siberian prisons. Her suffering made her popular among opponents of the Tsarism throughout the empire, and when she returned from Siberia she was seen as the heroine of the destituted and of the peasants.‚Å†
