Lyudmila Mikhailovna Pavlichenko (1916-1974) was a Soviet sniper in the Red Army during WWII. As a kid she was described as a tomboy, and as being fiercely competitive and athletic. She joined a shooting club in Kiev, and she learned how to be a sharpshooter. As a teenager she attended evening school and during the day worked as a grinder, and later she studied history, intending to become a teacher. When in 1941 Germany started to invade Russia, she showed up at a recruitment office: they offered her to be a nurse, but she asked to be enrolled in the infantry. Seeing her abilities as marksman, they let her in as a sniper. She is credited 309 confirmed kills, making her the most successful female sniper in history. Her ability gained her the nickname of "Lady Death", and after suffering an injury and being removed from the front she went on training other snipers for the Red Army.‚Å†
