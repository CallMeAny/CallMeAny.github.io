Baroness Bertha von Suttner (1843-1914) grew up in an eccentric family: her mother and aunt considered themselves clairvoyant, and therefore periodically took up gambling hoping in increasing their fortune. This resulted multiple times in financial disaster, forcing the family to move in smaller properties. This, added to the fact that Bertha's ancestry wasn't of pure aristocracy, kept her away from Austrian court. However, Bertha still got an excellent education: in times of hardship, she took up writing as a supporting career, becoming also a journalist. She wrote pacifist pieces, of which the novel Die Waffen nieder! (Lay Down Your Arms!) was particularly successful. Her pacifism was based on the idea that peace is a natural state, and so the right to peace could be demanded under international law and was necessary in the context of an evolutionary Darwinist conception of history. Moreover, she brought forward ideas like women being equal to men, and showing how sexism affects both men and women. Thanks to her work, in 1905 she became the first woman to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.‚Å†
