Noor Inayat Khan (1914-1944) was a British spy who grew up from an Indian family in Paris. Before WWII stroke, she was starting an artistic career in music and poetry, but when the Germans took over France she had to flee to England. Although she had pacifist ideals, she joined the Airforce. She hoped that an Indian could win some high military distinction during the war, to help close the gap between India and England. She got enlisted by the Special Operations Executive, and got special training as a wireless operator in occupied french territory. Her job was to keep London updated about the plans and needs of the resistance, while not being detected by the Germans. In 1943, an operator's life expectancy was six weeks. Noor started her job mid June 1943, and was arrested after betrayal in mid October 1943. During her detention she tried to escape twice, and while interrogated lied consistently and didn't give any information. However the Germans found her notebooks, in which, maybe for a misunderstanding or for a lack of training, she had noted all of the messages she had sent. She was kept prisoner for almost a year, and then executed in the Dachau concentration camp.‚Å†
