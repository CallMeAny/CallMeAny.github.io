Ann Makosinski is an inventor, and she started really soon to have brilliant ideas: in grade 7, she invented a radio that could be powered with the heat of a candle. After seeing how her friends in the Philippines could not study at night because they had no light, she invented the Hollow Flashlight: it is enough to hold it in your hands, and the human heat will power it. With this device she won the Google Science Fair, category 15-16yo. It's only one of the prizes that she has won since, and in 2017 she was also listed by Fores in the list of 30 Under 30. She was a speaker in many TED Talks, here is her most watched one: https://bit.ly/2YavkCZ‚Å†
