Augusta Ada King (1815-1852), Countess of Lovelace, was the only legitimate child of the poet Lord Byron. Although born in an era where female education was still uncommon, she was educated by a former Cambridge professor and discovered a great talent for maths. She also loved studying machines, and developed schemas for a flying machine based on birds anatomy and powered by a steam engine. When Ada was 17 she was introduced to Charles Babbage, who was working on a mechanical machine able to solve math operations. This machine was never actually built, but fascinated Ada to the point that her knowledge about it surpassed the one of Charles. She realized that if the machine could operate on numbers it could also operate on symbols, and therefore be used for more complex calculations. She is regarded as the mother of computer science, because she published the first ever known algorithm for a machine to calculate Bernoulli numbers.‚Å†
