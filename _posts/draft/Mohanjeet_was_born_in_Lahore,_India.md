Mohanjeet was born in Lahore, India (now Pakistan), in a large Sikh family, which migrated to Patiala, Punjab, during the partition. Of a very independent nature, she graduated at the age of age of thirteen and then majored in philosophy at the university. 
At the beginning of the 1950s, Mohanjeet moved to Los Angeles where she studied political science, and then moved to New York to start a career as journalist. 
She worked for the New York Herald Tribune and then for the New York Times: she was the very first representative from India and the first foreigner to work with the major American newspapers.
While working for the United Nations Mohanjeet joined the communications department of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Wien, Austria, and then spent her first year in Paris at the UNESCO office, still working for the press.
In 1962, ten years after her departure, accompanying Jackie Kennedy, she returned to India and there covered continued her journalistic career, collaborating with the Times of India, All India Radio, and the American News Agency, for which she interviewed among others Nehru and Indira Gandhi. 
In this period Mohanjeet develops a new interest for art and creation: she starts collecting unique models, fabrics, jewelry, cosmetics, modern and contemporary art... in Paris she builds an indian fashion house and opens a few shops. Her first customers and friends were Romain Gary, Jean Seberg, Catherine Deneuve, Yves Saint Laurent, Jane Fonda... In this year 2021, Mohanjeet celebrates the 50th anniversary of her flagship boutique.
Mohanjeet's creations are Stories: each collection of unique designs, each accessory speaks of a region of India, of Mohanjeet's way of weaving together tradition and modernity, of the way she wears them, of how she takes hold of them, in a word: of living them, with respect for the infinite depth of all living things.
