Anok Yai (1997- ) got discovered as a model during the Howard University's homecoming week: a professional photographer took her picture, which got more then 20000 likes when he posted it on Instagram. Modeling agencies started to get in touch with Anok, who signed with one of them after several weeks: her success was striking, and within 4 months she became the first Sudanese model to open a Prada fashion show, and the second model to do so after Naomi Campbell. Anok saw her opening of the Prada show as a statement to the world that the beauty of black women is something to be celebrated.‚Å†
