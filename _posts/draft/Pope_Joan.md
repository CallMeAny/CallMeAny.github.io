Pope Joan (in charge 855-857, legend) was a literate and talented English woman. She used to dress up as a man, possibly to appease a request from her lover, and she was so convincing that she managed to get initiated as monk. From there, with her knowledge she was able to rise through the church hierarchy and was eventually elected pope. However, she wasn't practicing celibacy, and she ended up pregnant: possibly due to the movements of the horse she was riding on, she went into labor in the middle of the road during the Easter procession, and she gave birth surrounded by all the fidels. Her story has different endings: some said she died of labor, some say she got stoned by the enraged people, some said she was hidden away by the church in a convent. It is said that the Pope that came after her her put all of his effort in deleting every trace of her existence, and that due to her disguising a new ritual (that never actually existed) was put in place to ensure the Pope-to-be was actually a man and not a woman or an eunuch.‚Å†
