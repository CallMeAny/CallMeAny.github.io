Greta Thunberg (2003-) grew up in Sweden, where she kept wondering why so little was being done to fight climate change. She started trying to convince her parents to lower the family's carbon footprint, and her success changing their own lifestyles gave her hope that she could make the difference. In 2018 she began the "school strike for climate", spending her school days in front of the Swedish parliament and asking for stronger actions against global warming. This inspired many other students, starting the Fridays for Future movement which counts by now about 4 million supporters. In the same year she held a speech at the UN Climate Change Conference, and in 2019 she spoke at the World Economic Forum in Davos, which she reached by train, and later sailed across the Atlantic Ocean on a solar boat to take part to the UN Climate Action Summit in New York. In September, Greta and 15 other children filed a lawsuit against five nations that are not on track to meet the emission reduction targets they committed to in their Paris Agreement pledges: the lawsuit is challenging the nations under the UN's Convention on the Rights of the Child, in particular the right to life, health, and peace.‚Å† Her opinion is that no one is too small to make a change! ‚Å†
