Vivian Maier (1926-2009) was a nanny for most of her life. She pursued photography in her spare time, taking about 150000 photographies of people and architecture mostly in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. Her work was discovered when, after missing payments, the content of her storage space was auctioned: after the buyer published some of the pictures on Flickr, they went viral and attracted critical praise. For example, one of the critics said that she showed the world of women and children in a way that was pretty much unprecedented. Nowadays, the Vivian Maier Scholarship Fund provides opportunity to female students with need for additional financial resources.‚Å†
