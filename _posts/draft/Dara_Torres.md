Dara Torres (1967-) started swimming at her community YMCA when she was 7 years old. She then joined a club, and at 14 she won the national open championship in the 50 yards freestyle. During high school she was also a member of the school basketball, gymnastics and volleyball teams. However her best sport always was swimming: she represented the US in five Olympic games and won medals in every one of them, for a total of 12 medals. She managed to make her last Olympic team when she was 41 years old, the oldest swimmer that ever managed to do that.‚Å†
