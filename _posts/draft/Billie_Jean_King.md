Billie Jean King (1943-) is regarded as being one of the greatest women's tennis players of all time: she won 39 Grand Slam titles, but most importantly she won the Battle of the Sexes by winning the match against Bobby Riggs in 1973. The famous exhibition match took place after Riggs' claim that women players were so inferior that even 55yo men like him could beat the current top female players. Billie Jean won the game with 6-4, 6-3, 6-3, and commented: "To beat a 55-year-old guy was no thrill for me. The thrill was exposing a lot of new people to tennis."⁠
