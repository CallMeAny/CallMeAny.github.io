Kumander Liwayway (1919-2014) was a commander for the Huk rebellion in the Philippines. As a teenager, she was interested in dressmaking and perfumes, but upon Japanese invasion during WWII she went for a different career. Her father had organized resistance against the Japanese, and for this he was tortured and executed, and his corpse displayed for everyone to see. Remedios Gomez-Paraiso, her real name, was inspired to leave home and join the guerrilla forces, stating that it was better than to die without putting up resistance. She first served as a nurse, but was quickly promoted to commander of her military squad, with her name meaning "Commander Dawn". She was known to fight in formal wear and wearing red lipstick: she was fighting for the right to be herself. Her squad fought off the Japanese during the Battle of Kamansi, when they refused to retreat although heavily outnumbered. She did not accept the victory over the Japanese as end of her fight: she went on with the Huks against the new Philippine democracy that she considered a farce.‚Å†
