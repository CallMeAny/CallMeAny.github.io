Sister Rosemary Nyirumbe lived through unsettling times in Uganda, while the army of Joseph Koni kidnapped children and forced them to become soldiers and commit atrocious crimes. Sister Rosemary opened centers that welcome former abducted girls, that with their past of torture, forced crimes and offspring from forced marriages to the rebels would have otherwise nowhere to go. Her vocational school in Gulu has welcomed more than 2000 girls, and while providing medical care and a safe place for their children, the girls have been taught business skills, secretarial studies, sewing and catering: these skills are fundamental for them to go back to a life where they can sustain themselves, and to help them heal from their traumas. Sister Roesemary built all of this showing great ingenuity, as the resources for such a center have always been scarce. But her success helped countless lifes, and earned her a spot in Time's 100 Most Influential People in 2014.‚Å†
