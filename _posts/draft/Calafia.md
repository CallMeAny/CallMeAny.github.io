Calafia (fictional) was the queen of the island of California, in an epic novel of chivalry written around 1510. The pagan queen ruled over a queendom of black women, all trained as warriors. Calafia, who wanted to achieve great things and see the world, was in command of a fleet of ships that she obtained as tribute from the surrounding lands, and her territory was defended by an army of griffins trained to see any man they found. She joined Muslims trying to retake Constantinople from the Christians, although she had no concept of either one of the religions. However her griffins start to attack her allies, as they can only distinguish between man and woman, not between Muslim and Christians. Moreover, the golden armors that Calafia's warriors are wearing are too soft to protect against arrows. Calafia decides to face the enemy princes in single combat to decide who wins the battle. She falls in love with one of these princes, and converts to Christianity to marry him and go back to California to start a new Christian dynasty complete of men and women.‚Å†
When this story was written, America had just been discovered by the European, and legends of a land of gold or a land ruled by warrior women was what led onward Spanish explorers. The details of the story reinforce the vision of Christianity as the one true religion, but most importantly highlights how Africans were seen as culturally advanced by Europeans in the 15th century, and the importance of black people in the exploration of the new continent.‚Å†
