Ameenah Gurib-Fakim (1959-) served as the 6th President of Mauritius from 2015 to 2018. However, before getting into politics, she was professor with a personal chair in Organic Chemistry at the University of Mauritius. She is a biodiversity scientist, and worked on the project of creating a database of all the plants on her island: when she was asked to become the president, she had the unique opportunity to bring her knowledge in her new role, and she works on rising awareness on global warming and on promoting scientific investments on her territory and on all of Africa.‚Å†
