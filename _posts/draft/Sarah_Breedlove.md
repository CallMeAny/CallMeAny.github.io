Sarah Breedlove (1867-1919), also known as Madam C. J. Walker, developed a line of beauty and hair products for black women. But before this, she had to work as a domestic and a laundress, earning barely enough to give her daughter an education. The harsh conditions in which she lived gave her scalp problems, which she tried to solve with the knowledge of her brothers, who were barbers. She built on that knowledge, and started selling her products door to door and teaching other black women how to style their hair. When she earned enough money, she also started to show other black women how to budget, become financially independent and start businesses.‚Å†
