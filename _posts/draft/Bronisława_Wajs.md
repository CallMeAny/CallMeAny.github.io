Bronis≈Çawa Wajs (1908-1987) is one of the most famous Romani poets ever, and is indeed commonly known with her Romani name of Papusza. She grew up in a nomad band of families, and learned to read from lessons villagers gave her in exchange for chickens. Her literacy was highly unusual, and totally frowned upon. She was married really young, and this made her unhappy: she started singing to take out her frustration, and soon she was composing her own ballads based on traditional Romani storytelling. Her poems often talked of the common theme of 'nostos', a return home: for the Romani people this was used to describe the desire to take the road, but when Papusza poems were published this was interpreted as her yearning to settle down. She also published an interview that had a little Romani-Polish dictionary attached to it: her people accused her of giving out the secrets of her culture, and even to be a supporter of the politics that wanted to force nomad people to settle. For this, she was labelled as traitor, declared unclean and banished: she spent the rest of her life alone writing about nostalgia, longing and feeling lost, while her work was being popularized for its cultural importance.‚Å†
