Margaret Hamilton (1936-) was the director of the Software Engineering Division of the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory, which developed on-board flight software for NASA's Apollo space program. Her most famous picture shows her standing next to the listings of the software she her team developed for the Apollo project. During her studies she pursued abstract mathematics, but inspired by her father and grandfather also minored in philosophy. After her studies she moved to Boston and started developing weather prediction and satellite tracking software: at that time, there was no way to learn development apart from hands-on experience. Thanks to her effort she became a candidate for the Apollo program. She managed to solve a critical problem during the Apollo 11 flight: 3 minutes before the moon landing, alarms were triggered because the computer was overloaded, but Margaret's recovery procedures was able to eliminate low priority tasks and allow the mission to go on.‚Å†
