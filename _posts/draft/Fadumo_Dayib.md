Fadumo Dayib (1972-) was the first woman to run for President of Somalia, in 2016. She was born in Kenya, where her family had moved after eleven of her siblings had died of preventable diseases. Fadumo parents were both illiterate, but her dad spoke several languages and her mom, selling tea at roadside, was a business woman. After some political issues, her mom had to sell everything they owned to allow Fadumo and her siblings to escape to Finland as refugees. Fadumo learned to read and write only when she was 14 years old, and in Finland she studied to become a critical care nurse: she has worked on the private sector and for the United Nations, setting up maternal health clinics and HIV prevention clinics in Somalia, and training health care providers for the UN. Facing death threats, she announced she wanted to run for President of Somalia in 2014, in the first democratic elections to be held since 1967. Her program includes anti-corruption policies, takings on female genital mutilation and dialoguing with al-Shabaab to prevent terrorism.‚Å†
