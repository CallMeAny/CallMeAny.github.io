Valentina Tereshkova (1937-) is the first and youngest woman to have been in space, in 1963. She did a solo mission, orbiting the Earth 48 times over almost three days. Before becoming a cosmonaut, Valentina was a textile factory worker and skydived as a hobby. During her training, she went through isolation tests, centrifuge tests, thermo-chamber and decompression chamber tests, plus training in jet fighters. At 26 years old she launched in the Vostok 6, and although she experimented some discomfort usual in space flights, she had a safe trip and landed parachuting over Kazakhstan. After her flight, she remained in the space program as a cosmonaut instructor and later requalifying for space flight.‚Å†
