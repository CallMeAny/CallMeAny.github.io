Sally Ride (1951-2012) was the first American woman in space, and the third overall after two USSR cosmonauts, and the first known lesbian person to do so. She was selected to be an astronaut as part of NASA Astronaut Group 8, the first class to select women. After graduating training, she served as capsule communicator, and helped develop the Canadarm robot arm. She took part in two missions on the Shuttle Challenger, and was completing her training for a third flight when the Challenger disaster occurred. Thanks to her experience, she was named into the commission investigating the disaster, and later also the Columbia disaster. Having never had female astronauts before, the engineers had to face some unforeseen challenges: in preparation of her first mission, which was planned to last one week, they asked her whether 100 tampons would be enough. It seems the conversation went more or less like this: "Is 100 the right number?" "That would not be the right number" "We just want to be safe." Poor engineers definitely needed a quick briefing on how period works.‚Å†
