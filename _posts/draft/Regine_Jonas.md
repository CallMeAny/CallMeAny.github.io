Regine Jonas (1902-1944) came from a strictly religious jew household in Berlin. As a young woman, she intended to make a career as a teacher, but became disillusioned with the idea and joined the Higher Institute for Jewish Studies in which she took seminary courses: she was not the only woman there, but was the only one with the goal of becoming a rabbi. She ended her studies with a thesis centered around "Can a woman be a rabbi according to Halachic sources", and her conclusion was that yes, she could be ordained. Her thesis was accepted by the Talmud professor responsible for ordinations, but his sudden death prevented him from ordering her. As other women before her, Regine was given a role similar to the one of a rabbi, but was not officially given the title: the fear was that a female rabbi would cause massive internal problems and clashes in the Jewis community. It took five years for a liberal rabbi to notice her and ordain her, but the community wasn't welcoming and Rebecca was turned away from Berlin's New Synagogue. When Nazi persecution started, she stayed in Nazi Germany, continuing her teaching and rabbinical work under harder and harder conditions, until the Gestapo confiscated all her property and deported her to Theresienstadt. There she continued her work, and helped building a crisis intervention service by screening newcomers at the train station with a questionnaire about suicide. She worked there for 2 years, writing at least 23 sermons and organizing cultural events to distract others from the grim events around them. In October 1944 she was deported to Auschwitz and murdered there. Her life and work was never mentioned by notable individuals who were at Theresienstadt, and only rediscovered in 1991 upon the opening of eastern Germany archives.‚Å†
