Dolores Huerta (1930-) was born in a Mexican immigrant family. As a kid she often heard her dad telling stories of workers organizing in unions. That's how she became an activist: she fought for improvements of migrant farmer lifes, explaining that they were payed close to nothing, had no rights, lived with no furniture and no clean water while working sunrise to sundown without breaks. Workers often travel where the crops are in season, and this meant that kids couldn't get a proper education. In 1965 Dolores directed a national boycott of the grape industry, resulting in a 3 year collective bargaining agreement with the United Farm Workers. She has also done lobbying for laws to improve farm workers lives: right to take driver's examination in Spanish, aids for families with children and so on. She suffered from police beating during a peaceful protest, and the recording of the event led to a change in the police's crowd control techniques. She supports the idea that the composition of parties and officers must reflect the ethnic diversity of the nation, and encourages Latinas to run for office.‚Å†
