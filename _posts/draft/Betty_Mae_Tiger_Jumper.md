Betty Mae Tiger Jumper (1923-2011) was the first and only female chief of the Seminole Tribe of Florida. At age 5 she was threatened to be put to death because her father was white and the tribe discouraged interracial marriage. However, her great-uncle protected her and moved the family in a reservation where children were protected. Betty Mae said she learned how to live by listening to the elders of the tribe telling the stories passed down from the ancestors, but she looked at the future: she was the first Florida Seminole to learn to read and write English, and the first to graduate from high school. She became a nurse, and founded a tribal newspaper, for which she served as editor, while also being the communication director for the tribe.‚Å†
