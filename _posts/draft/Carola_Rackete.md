Carola Rackete (1988-) is a German sea captain working for the sea rescue organization Sea Watch. She picked up 53 migrants in the Mediterranean, and instead of docking in Tripoli, considered unsafe by humanitarian organizations, she headed for Lampedusa, the nearest safe harbor per maritime law. But due to politics, Italian ports were closed, and after long days waiting she decided to dock without authorization because her passengers were exhausted. She was arrested while disembarking, and caused a diplomatic incident because of a collision with an Italian patrol boat that was trying to stop her. To her adversaries her actions were human trafficking, but she got released on the fact that she broke no laws and acted to protect passengers' safety.⁠
