Maryam Mirzakhani (1977-2017) was a brilliant Iranian mathematician, listed in Popular Science's "Brilliant 10" as one of the top young minds that pushed their fields in innovative directions. In 2014, Maryam received the Fields Medal, the most prestigious award in mathematics, and became the first (and currently only) woman and Iranian to be honored with the award. Her brilliance in mathematics allowed her to win the Iranian National Olympiad and thus bypassing the the national college entrance exams. Later, she won the International Mathematical Olympiad, in 1994 with a score of 41 out of 42 pints, and in 1995 with perfect score. After obtaining her Bachelor of Science she moved to the US to work on her PhD: Harvard University said she was determined and relentlessly questioning, although she wasn't a native English speaker. She took notes in Persian, and her daughter said that her works look like paintings, because she liked to doodle on the paper and write formulas around the drawings. In 2014, the Fields Medal was awarded to her for "her outstanding contributions to the dynamics and geometry of Riemann surfaces and their moduli spaces": in a simplification of her work, it was said that she mixed dynamics with geometry, taking the example of a billiard table shape-shifting following certain rules over the universe of all possible billiard tables.‚Å†
