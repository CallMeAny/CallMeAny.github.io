Aisha Bakari Gombi used to be a antelope hunter, but has now been recruited by the army to help finding and rescuing people taken hostage by the terror group Boko Haram. Her land, north Nigeria, has been plagued by this kind of guerrilla since a while, and she leads a command of men to fight the terrorists. They communicate using sign language and animal sounds, and they have rescued hundreds of people. She is seen as a heroine, and the locals call her Queen Hunter‚Å†
