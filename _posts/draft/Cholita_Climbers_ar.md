Cholita Climbers are a group of women from the Aymara indigenous nation in the Andes over Bolivia, Peru and Chile. The ladies are known for climbing different mountains throughout all Latin America while wearing their traditional dresses of colorful long skirts, together with the usual safety gear. The ladies, aged between 24 and 50, already were involved in the mountaineering world, being married to climbers and working as cooks and porters. They started their adventure with only the knowledge they had picked up from watching their partners or tourists, and they were harshly judged for their decision. They started in 2015 with 11 members, and already in 2017 they moved from climbing as hobby to start accompanying tourists as regular guide. For this, they took climbing and safety courses to get the professional accreditation.‚Å†
