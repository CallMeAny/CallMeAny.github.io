National Coalition of American Nuns (NCAN, founded in 1969) represents about 2000 Catholic nuns who promotes "diverse feminist, faith-filled voices". As early as 1972, NCAN promoted the idea that women should be fully welcomed into the church, including the priesthood. They published a 5-year plan to achieve gender equality within and outside the church, advocating for reformation of the economic and power system. They fully supported 2018 Women's Marches around the world, and condemned the "vulgar words" used by president Trump. In contrast with the official catholic church position, NCAN advocates for reproductive justice, meaning the right of a woman to choose what is best for herself, including using contraceptives and having access to abortion. NCAN members volunteered to escort women through protests outside of abortion clinics. Fighting the image that nuns are strict and repressive, NCAN also supports the LGBT community and its acceptance into the church. Due to these liberal positions, NCAN has caused controversy among other christian people and within the Vatican itself.‚Å†
