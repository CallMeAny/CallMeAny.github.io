Johanna Nordblad (1975-) is a freediver who competes among the best in the World Championship. In fact, in 2004 she broke the female record in freediving with fins, swimming 158 meters in 6m 39s. She was also the coach for the men's team, preparing them for the world cup in 2014. After a biking accident she started cold water therapy, and from there she discovered a passion for diving under the ice, for example under the Arctic. In 2015 she broke the female record diving for 50 meters under the ice in 2 °C cold water, while only wearing a swimsuit and mask.⁠
