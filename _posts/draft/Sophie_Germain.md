Sophie Germain (1776-1831) was 13 years old when the Bastille fell during the French revolution, and the instability of the city forced her to stay indoor: for entertainment, she started going through her father's library, and got intrigued by the books about mathematics, and in particular of geometry. She even taught herself latin and greek, so that she could read ancient treaties. ‚Å†
Sophie's parents didn't approve of her interest, deeming it inappropriate for a woman, and started denying her warm clothes and a fire for her bedroom trying to stop her from studying: after they left, she would wrap herself in quilts, take out candles and do mathematics. After some time, her mother finally starting supporting her, although secretly.‚Å†
While the university system prevented her from taking part to the lessons due to her gender, the education system made the lecture notes available to all who asked: she obtained them, and started submitting her work with the name of a former student. When the faculty member Lagrange noted the intelligence of such works he requested a meeting in person, and Sophie was forced to disclose her identity: luckily Lagrange didn't mind that she was a woman, and become her mentor. Sophie kept learning, and was recommended for an honorary degree, which she never obtained: due to her sex, she was never able to make a career out of mathematics, and had to work to support herself. But her scientific results were astounding: her work on Fermat's Last Theorem was used as base of work for decades to come, and she won the Paris Academy of Science grand prize for her essay on elasticity theory explaining why sand arranges itself in a pattern when put on a vibrating glass surface. For this last problem a public was issued in France, and Sophie was the only one submitting her work, after six years of research. In her honor, the Academy of Science established the Sophie Germain Prize.‚Å†
