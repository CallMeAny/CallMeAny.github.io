Anita Garibaldi (1821-1849) was a revolutionary woman that fought as a skilled horsewoman and swordswoman for the independence of her homeland, Brazil, from Portugal. She met her lover and later husband Giuseppe Garibaldi (the Italian revolutionary) and they fought together, until the day they become separated in battle and she was captured by the enemies. They told her that Giuseppe was dead, and allowed her to search among the fallen: she did not find her lover, but managed to mount a horse and attempt to escape. They run after her, but after she started wading a river they thought she could not survive and let her go. She did survive, and after wandering for long days she could find some help and get reunited with her man.‚Å†
