Lozen (1840-1889) was a warrior and prophet of the Chihenne Chiricahua Apache. She was the sister of chief Victorio, who said she was as strong as a man, braver than most, and cunning in strategy. Her ability was so good that people said she had the power to learn the movements of the enemy in battle. Lozen fought on raids when her tribe was confined in the reservation, and while fleeing American forces she inspired and helped women and children to win their fears and cross the Rio Grande. After everybody was safe on the other side, she returned with the warriors. Another time, she left the band to escort a newborn and the mother to a safer location, on the way stealing horse from the Mexican chivalry for the mom and only using the knife to hunt so that no gunshot would betray her presence.‚Å†
