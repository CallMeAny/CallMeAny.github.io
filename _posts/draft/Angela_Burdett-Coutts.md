Angela Burdett-Coutts (1814-1906) became one of the wealthiest women in England when she inherited her grandfather's fortune. She spent the majority of her wealth in scholarships, endowments and philanthropic causes, for example co-founding a home for young women who had "turned to a life of immorality" where the ladies were to be taught discipline, literacy and household skills, while exposing them to social occasions. Angela didn't take political positions, but tried to improve the conditions of indigenous Africans and the help with education and relief of the poor in any part of the world, for example taking interest in a project to find better drinking water for those living in Jerusalem.‚Å†
