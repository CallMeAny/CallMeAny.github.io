Kazuyo Sejima (1956-) is a Japanese architect, and the first woman to be appointed director of architecture sector for the Venice Biennale, which she curated for the 12th Annual International Architecture Exhibition. Her work incorporates glass and marble, creating slick surfaces and curves for buildings that integrate nicely with their surroundings. She tries to challenge the conventional process of design, consciously confronting each part of the design operations. ‚Å†
