Nellie Melba (1861-1931) studied singing in Melbourne and made a modest success there, but she moved to Europe searching for a better singing career. Her first attempt in London didn't go well, being criticized as having a respectable voice but lacking personal charm seen as necessary to become a great figure in the lyric scene. So she left England, and in Paris she got a totally opposite critique: not only her voice was described as having great flexibility, but also her acting was praised for being expressive and striking. From that moment, Nellie's success kept growing, although interestingly her repertoire was rather small: in her whole career she sang no more than 25 roles, and was closely identified with only ten. Also, she only sung a little German opera, focusing instead on French and Italian pieces. Even with these restrictions, Nellie became one of the most famous singers of the late Victorian era, and was the first Australian to get international recognition as classical musician. To her memory, the Australian $100 note features her image.‚Å†
