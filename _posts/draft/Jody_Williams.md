Jody Williams (1950-) has devoted her life to ban anti-personnel landmines, working in defense of human rights (especially women's) and on the understanding of the concept of security worldwide. Her work against landmines, scoring a huge success with a signed international treaty banning them, won her a Nobel Prize for Peace. After getting the prize, she established the Nobel Women‚Äôs Initiative, where six female Peace Laureates work to promote women achievement for peace, justice and equality.‚Å†
