Mary Kingsley (1862-1900) grew up with little formal education, because at the time girls were mostly just seen as future wifes. However, she loved reading and started going through memories of explorers in her dad's bookshelves. She decided to travel African West coast, all alone: even the locals were surprised that she wasn't traveling with a man. She lived with local people, who taught her surviving skills for the times she ventured into the wilderness on her own. She had a bit of nursing skills, that she used to cure little injuries and help with jungle maladies. Her work helped shape European perception of African cultures and British imperialism.‚Å†
