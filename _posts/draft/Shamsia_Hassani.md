Shamsia Hassani (1988-) is an Afghan graffiti artist. She spent her childhood in Iran, where her family had moved due to the war, and although she was always interested in painting she had to wait until their return to Kabul to be allowed to follow art classes. In Kabul, she pursued a bachelor degree in painting and a master degree in visual arts. She became associate professor of Drawing and Anatomy Drawing at Kabul university, and has established an art collective called Berang Arts. She discovered street art during a workshop, and realizing that those supplies are cheaper than the ones needed for traditional art forms, she continued with that. With her graffiti she tries to mask the negativity of war, and to fight for women rights, showing colorful images of energetic women wearing burqas. All of her works need to be completed in less than 15 minutes, to avoid public harassment and claims of being un-Islamic.‚Å†
