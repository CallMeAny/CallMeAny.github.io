Rebecca Lukens (1794-1854) is known as America's first female CEO of an industrial company. The iron and steel mill was founded by his father, whom she often accompanied on business trips. When her father died, she leased the mill together with her husband, who started experimenting with new products: their rolled steel plate was used to construct the first metal hulled steamboat, and later became the boilerplate in steam engines and locomotives. When Rebecca became a widow, she was left in charge of a company near bankruptcy, which she managed to save and turn into the country's premier manufacturer of boilerplates: thanks to her managing abilities, she was named in the National Business Hall of Fame in 1994.‚Å†
