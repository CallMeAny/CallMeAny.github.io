Sappho (~630-~570 BC) is known for her poetry written to be sung accompanied by a lyre. Sadly most of her work got lost, but it is known that her popularity was so high that she was known as "The Poetess". The legend says that the reason her work got lost is that the church disapproved her morals. She is still known as a symbol of love and desire between women, and she was historically described as promiscuous and bisexual. Her only complete surviving text is "Ode to Aphrodite", a poem at least partially humorous, that takes the form of a prayer to Aphrodite, goddess of love, from a speaker who longs for the attentions of an unnamed woman. It is from here, where Sappho names herself as the praying character, and a single word identifies the desired love as female, that most of the legends started.‚Å†
