Alicia Alonso (1920-) started dancing when she was a kid, in Havana. After falling in love with a fellow dancer, they moved to Manhattan and she continued training at the School of American Ballet. In 1941, after realizing something was wrong with her eyes, she was diagnosed with a detached retina: she had to undergo invasive surgeries, and never regained proper sight. However, she went back to dance and became a star by replacing the prima ballerina for Gilselle shortly after having restarted. She overcame her less-than-perfect vision by training her partners to be exactly where she expected them, and by using colored spotlights as cues on her position.‚Å†
