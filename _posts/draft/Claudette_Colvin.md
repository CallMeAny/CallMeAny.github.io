Claudette Colvin (1939-) was arrested in Montgomery, Alabama, for refusing to give up her seat to a white woman on a crowded segregated bus. While the bus system was mostly used by black people, the rules were that if the white part was full then people of color had to give up their seats to go stand in the back. When this happened and Claudette refused to give up her seat, she was thinking of the people who fought before her, against all sorts of abuse, for example the fact that black people was not allowed to use dressing rooms in stores and had to buy clothes based on diagrams of their own measures.‚Å†
The bus incident involving Claudette happened nine months before the more famous one that involved Rosa Parks. While her case helped spark the bus boycott that led to the end of bus segregation in Alabama, her case was not publicized by Montgomery black leaders because, among other things like being a teenager and not being fair-skinned, at the time she was pregnant with a child out of wedlock: if the white press would have known this information, they would have called her a bad girl and the case wouldn't have had a chance. Rosa Parks was bound to be more accepted by the white media as the public face of the movement, but Claudette was among those who started it all. However, due to her actions, Claudette was labeled as troublemaker from her own community, and as Rosa also did, she had to move to another city because in Montgomery she couldn't find a job and life was a struggle.‚Å†
