Negin Khpalwak (1997-) is the conductor of Zohra, an all-female Afghan orchestra named after the Persian goddess of music. The girls in the orchestra moved to Kabul from all over the country, to be the first women in 30 years to study music: in their country, music was banned by the Talibans. Playing is risky, even members of their families are against it. Negin had to learn in secret, and was lucky that her father was supportive when she told him. The orchestra managed to even play at the World Economic Forum, and when they came back to Afghanistan they were welcomed with flowers and broadcasted in live tv.‚Å†
