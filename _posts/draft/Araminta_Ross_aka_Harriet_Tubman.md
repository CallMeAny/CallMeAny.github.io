Araminta Ross aka Harriet Tubman (1822-1913) was born into slavery and often beaten by various masters during the time she served for them. One incident got so bad she suffered a critical head injury when a metal bar that was meant to hit another slave, had hit her instead. She was left for 2 days fighting for her life with an unaided head injury. This resulted in Tubman experiencing visions and strange dreams which she described as premonitions from God. In 1849 she escaped to Philiadelphia, where she embarked on her courageous mission by returning to Maryland to rescue her family. She then started guiding dozens of other slaves to freedom by working in secrecy at night. Nicknamed Moses she became the first woman to lead an armed expedition (guiding the raid of the Combahee ferry) which liberated over 700 people who were enslaved. With her actions, Harriet Tubman became the icon for freedom.‚Å†
