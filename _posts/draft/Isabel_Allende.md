Isabel Allende (1942-) is a Chilean writer, known for mixing myth and realism in her novels, often taking inspiration from personal experiences and historical events. She used to work as Spanish translator for English works, but she was fired after altering dialogues to make the female characters sound more intelligent. Due to a political coup that threatened her life, she was forced to flee to Venezuela, and that allowed her to flourish, away from a patriarchal setting that would have expected her to be an obedient family woman. Although her writings attracted some negative criticism, being described as commercial rather than literary relevant, she was also described as "literary legend", in an article that named her the third most influential Latino leader in the world.‚Å†
