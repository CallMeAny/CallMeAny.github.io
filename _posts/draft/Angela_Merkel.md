Angela Merkel (1954-) is the Chancellor of Germany since 2005, and is defined by many the leader of the European Union, the most powerful woman in the world and, after Donald Trump's election, even the new leader of the Free World. She grew up in East Germany, where she learned to speak Russian and studied physics, up to obtaining a doctorate in quantum chemistry. She wanted to be an assistant professor at an engineering school, but one of the requirements was to report on her colleagues to the Stasi officers: she declined, saying that she was not good enough in keeping secrets to be a spy. She became involved in politics after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, until reaching her current position. Her politics are about immigrants integration and European cooperation.‚Å†
