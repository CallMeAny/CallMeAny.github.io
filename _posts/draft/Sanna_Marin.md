Sanna Marin (1985-) became prime minister of Finland on 2019, and at age 35 she is the world's youngest female state leader and Finland's youngest prime minister. Her mother and dad split up when she was very young, and she was brought up by her mother and her mother's female partner. She gained a master in ‚Å†
Administrative Science while working in a bakery and a as a cashier to sustain herself. She got involved in politics when she was 20 years old, and after being elected in the City Council of Tampere she became the chairperson within months: she gained prominence after videos of her chairing contentious meetings were shared on YouTube. In December 2019, her party nominated her to succeed the Finnish Prime Minister, and when she succeeded she formed a cabinet made with a majority of women. She was put on multiple "100 women" lists, from BBC to Forbes to Time.‚Å†
