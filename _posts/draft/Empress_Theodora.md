Empress Theodora (~500-548) became a Eastern Roman empress upon his husband Justinian accession. At a young age she served in a brothel serving low-status customers, and later became a dancer and actress there. She traveled to North Africa as concubine, and after being abandoned she met Justinian while dancing at the hippodrome races. At the time it was illegal to marry outside of rank, so Justinian changed the law so that he could make Theodora his wife. She was given the imperial seal, meaning that her consent was needed before any decision had legal validity, and she was in charge of holding court on her own when the emperor was unwell. She proved herself a worthy leader when during a riot she advised the emperor against fleeing, with a determined speech showing how it is better to die as a ruler rather than hiding in exile. Justinian stayed, and restored order, albeit committing a massacre against the rioters.‚Å†
