Alice B. Clement (1878-1926) was called the female Sherlock Holmes of Chicago, where she was a renowned detective. In fact, she was so famous that she had a series in a newspaper and starred in her own movie, titled ‚ÄúDregs of the City‚Äù. Not only was she the first female detective in Chicago, but very likely in all of the Unites States. She first joined the Chicago Police patrolling department stores in search of pickpockets, becoming detective in 1913, at the age of 35: she was known to enter crime scenes with gowns and beautiful hair-do, and being unapologetic of her lifestyle. She was loved by the media but not so much among the police force, however she and successive female PDs were so successful that their superior resigned. ‚Å†
One of Alice's most famous case even inspired Agata Christie "The Dulcimer" story, involving a murdered young woman: the woman was most likely a prostitute ill of typhoid, and Alice's male colleagues assumed she had just succumbed to her "lifestyle". Alice wasn't convinced of this, and further investigations revealed that the woman had acquired typhoid as part of a murder plot.‚Å†
Alice didn't spend all of her time on crime scenes: she also walked the city streets, helping in car accidents or rescuing runaways and destitute girls, while campaigning for women‚Äôs voting rights, the repeal of prohibition and the right of divorce.‚Å†
Her success grew more and more, until tension within the police force resulted in her being demoted and forced to take a medical leave, when the diabetes that she had managed to hide up until that point led to her death.‚Å†
