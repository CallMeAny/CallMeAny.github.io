Jeanne Baret (1740-1807) is recognized to be the first woman to complete the circumnavigation of the globe, as she was a member of de Bougainville's expedition. She boarded disguised as a man, enlisting herself as valet and assistant of the expedition's naturalist, for whom she worked as housekeeper and because she was an expert botanist herself. On the ship she could have significant privacy and private toilet facilities, as the naturalist and her assistant got assigned the captain's cabin due to the large amount of equipment they were bringing. Although it seems that rumors on Jeanne's gender were ongoing for a long time, it took almost 2 years for her to be confronted about it. When discovered, she said that she was an orphan and lost her fortune in a lawsuit, but this seems to be a story she made to protect the naturalist from being accused of complicity.‚Å†
