Pauline L√©on (1768-1838) was born in a family of chocolate makers, and started helping with the business after her father died. Those were the years of the French revolution, and Pauline got politically involved by affiliating herself with the radical anti-royalists, to the point of being part of the crowd that stormed the Bastille, carrying her own pike. Her involvement was noteworthy, because she came from the artisan class while most of the other involved women were aristocratic. During the revolution, revolutionaries all over France were exploring the ideas of men rights, and this stirred women to bring up the issue of women rights and their place in society: Pauline addressed the Legislative Assembly with a petition to create an all-female militia so that women could protect their homes from counter-revolutionary assaults. This idea was even more radical that it sounds nowadays, because the implied right to bear arms was closely associated with full citizenship.‚Å†
Pauline's positions got her arrested, but given that she had not committed any major crime, she was released a few months later, and she decided to pull herself from political scene to focus more on her occupation as a schoolteacher.‚Å†
