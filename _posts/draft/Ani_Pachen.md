Ani Pachen (1933-2002) was a tibetan freedom fighter and activist. She got initiated to the use of firearms by her father, in light of the increasing tensions with China after the Dalai Lama signed the Seventeen Point Agreement. Her father let her sit in the administrative meetings with local chieftains, and although Ani pursued religious training, she went back to learn the duties of a chieftain's heir. She assumed the role of chieftainess of the Kemdha clan upon her father's death, and she rode at the head of 600 resistance fighters into the nearby hills. Her group grew in size when families joined to avoid the threat of a possible Chinese attack, so she reorganized dividing refugees in smaller and less visible groups and dispatching defensive patrols or engaging in armed warfare. When China attacked, Ani managed to run and travel towards India for almost a month, before being captured. She was kept prisoner and regularly questioned, beaten and asked denounce her religion. She reported that they were forced to wear Chinese uniforms and were forbidden to speak Tibetan, pray or practice any Tibetan custom. She was finally released 21 years later, and she went on a pilgrimage to visit monasteries that were destroyed during the Cultural Revolution that had happened while she was imprisoned. ‚Å†
