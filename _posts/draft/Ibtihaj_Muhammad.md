Ibtihaj Muhammad (1985-) is a saber fencer, and is part of the US fencing team. In the 2016 Olympics in Rio she earned a bronze medal in the Team Sabre event, becoming the first Muslim-American to ear a medal at the Olympics. Her parents suggested she started practicing fencing because it was a sport that would allow her to wear her hijab, which she started wearing at a very young age. In the Rio Olympics she became the first US athlete to compete wearing a hijab, although she pointed out that she did not feel safe as a Muslim living in America. She thought that keeping the hijab would inspire women around the world to pursue their dreams even while preserving modesty, and with her siblings she launched a clothing company, aiming to bring modest fashionable clothing in the US market: this is an idea she had when as a kid she ralized that her dolls looked nothing like her, and started using scraps of fabrics to make little hijabs for them.⁠
