Clemantine Wamariya (1988-) was forced to flee her home when her Tutsi family was targeted in the Rwandan genocide. She was six years old at the time, and had to spend several years traveling through Africa before being granted a refugee visa in the US. There she finally started attending school at the age of 13, and she went on with her studies until obtaining a degree in Comparative Literature from Yale University. Clementine gained the attention of the public thanks to her multiple appearances in the Oprah Winfrey Show, where she was first invited to talk about her experience about the genocide. Her ability for public speaking landed her invitations by event organizers, especially in the humanitarian aid sector. She held a TED talk called "War and what comes after", and co-authored a book about her own life.⁠
