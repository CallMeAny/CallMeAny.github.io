Dorothy Hodgkin (1910-1994) grew up between England and Africa, where she lived in Egypt and Sudan. In Sudan she was one of the few girls allowed to study chemistry, a passion that stem in her and was nourished by a book she received when she was 16 about X-ray crystallography, a technique to determine the 3D structure of molecules: that's what helped her decide her future. Her exotic education didn't include Latin, so she had to take extra classes to pass the Oxford entrance examination. She got accepted, and ended up receiving a first-class honors degree at the University. She ended up researching X-ray crystallography, and advanced the technique: she confirmed the structure of penicillin, got a Nobel Prize for the structure of vitamin B12, and after 35 years of work also the structure of insulin.‚Å†
