Frances Arnold (1956-) has a mechanical and aerospace engineering degree, and she envisioned herself becoming a diplomat or CEO. She had considered getting a degree in international affairs, but after a year working in a factory producing nuclear reactor parts, she completed her studies focusing on solar and sustainable energy sources. From there she moved to chemical engineering and the involved biochemistry. She holds more than 40 patents, and is a founder or co-founder of multiple companies all related to environment friendly technologies. Thanks to her research on directed evolution, which encourages the production of enzymes to speed up chemical reactions, she was awarded the Nobel Prize in 2018, and is also the first woman winning many other important prizes in the field.‚Å†
