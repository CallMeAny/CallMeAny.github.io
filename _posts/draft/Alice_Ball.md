Alice Ball (1892-1916) was an African-American pharmacist and chemist, the first woman and first black person to get a master's degree from University of Hawaii, and also the first female chemistry professor there. In Hawaii she studied the properties of chaulmoogra oil, the best treatment available for leprosy, and developed an injectable form that was much more effective that the other existing options: before her finding leprosy was had no chance of recovery and people affected were exiled, but with the new injection the oil was effectively absorbed by the body and the cure could be successful. Alice died while giving a demonstration on how to use a gas mask, maybe due to chlorine poisoning, but her death certificate was altered to report tuberculosis as cause of death.‚Å†
