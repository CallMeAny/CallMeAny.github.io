Martina Bergman-√ñsterberg (1849-1915) was a Swedish woman who studied Gymnastics in Stockholm. When she moved to Britain she inserted physical education as a full subject in the English school curriculum. She founded the first physical education instructor's college in England, and she only admitted women: she was responsible for the instruction of female physical training teachers and with certifying their competence. During her appointment she trained 1312 teachers.‚Å†
