Anne Sullivan (1866-1936) grew up in poverty, and she contracted trachoma, which damaged her eye sight severely. After the death of her mom, her strong personality clashed against her father's, resulting in him being abusive and abandoning her and her sibling: they were send in a home for the poor, but conditions were so horrid and the place was so crowded, the Anne's younger sibling passed away just a month after moving there. At the home, Anne had heard about schools for the blind and had found aspirations to get an education to escape poverty: when members of special commissions were visiting the house, she summoned the courage to ask them to be sent to school. In 1880, she attended Perkin School for the Blind, and had surgery to improve her vision. Anne managed to excel academically and was chosen to be Valedictorian. She was soon hired as a governess for the Keller family in Alabama, where she was supposed to teach their daughter Helen Keller: Anne had learned methods to teach the blind and deaf, and although disagreeing on the slave ownership of the family, she quickly bonded with Helen. Anne taught her vocabulary based on her interests, by spelling words on her palm: the method was extremely successful, and Helen got to know about 600 words, multiplication tables and Braille within 6 months. Thanks to her work, Anne was awarded multiple honorary fellowships and degrees.‚Å†
