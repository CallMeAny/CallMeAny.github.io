Naomi Campbell (1970-) was discovered as a model at age 15. She never met her father, who abandoned her mother while she was pregnant, and took the Campbell surname from her stepfather. From age 3 Naomi had studied dance, and first appeared in a music video at age 7, for a Bob Marely's song. She intended to pursuit a career as a dancer, but got scouted instead and her modelling career quickly took off: she appeared on the cover of British Elle before her 16th birthday. She faced some racial discrimination, and through her entire career never earned as much as her white colleagues. Nevertheless, she received support from the other models: if Naomi couldn't get the jobs, the other girls wouldn't accept the job either. She was the first black model on the cover of multiple editions of Vogue. In the 90s she was declared "the reigning megamodel of them all", and for her and a handful or her colleagues the term "supermodel" came into use. At the end of the supermodel era, while still appearing on the catwalk, Naomi pursued other ventures, for example music, cosmetics and acting. She is active in multiple charities, and has spoken against discrimination and for social integration and inclusion multiple times.‚Å†
