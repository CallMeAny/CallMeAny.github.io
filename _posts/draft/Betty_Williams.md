Betty Williams (1943-) grew up in Belfast, where she became a peace activist after witnessing three kids being killed in a car accident after the driver, a fugitive from paramilitary IRA, was shot and lost control. Within two days of the incident she had collected 6000 signatures in a petition for peace. She organized a peaceful march to the graves of the victims of the incident, attended by 10000 participants, but the event was disrupted by the IRA. So she organized another march, this time attended by 35000 participants. For her work she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for her job, together with Mairead Maguire. She is a member of the PeaceJam foundation, an organization that aims to create young leaders, and of the Nobel Women's Initiative, to support effort for women's rights.‚Å†
