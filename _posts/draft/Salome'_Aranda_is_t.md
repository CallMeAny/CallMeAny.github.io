Salome' Aranda is the leader of the Kichwa people in the Ecuadorian Amazon. She works to defend the rainforest from oil drillings, and to preserve the dignity of her people. The forest is what gives them sustenance and life, and preserving it is vital for her and her people. Salome' spoke with the president Moreno about environmental impacts of oil company activities on her ancestral land, and she brought up cases of sexual abuse against indigenous women. But the only result is the her and her family were attacked and threatened with stones at their home. ‚Å†
