Odetta Holmes (1930‚Äì2008) was known as "the Voice of Civil Rights Movement". It was a teacher noticing her vocal talent, and encouraging her to pursue a career: she started operatic training when she was 13 years old, and then went on studying music while working as domestic help to support herself. She joined various groups, touring the country, and in the 50s after focusing on folk singing she started a solo career and she also took up acting. Her singing inspired even bigger figures like Bob Dylan and Janis Joplin, while being remembered for her singing of "O Freedom" at the 1963 March on Washington: she is known as a civil rights and human rights activist, but she describes her role as "one of the privates in a very big army"‚Å†
