Jane Goodall (1934-) is a world famous expert on chimpanzees: her love for animals started when her dad gave her a stuffed chimpanzee instead of a teddy bear. When she started her research on primates she was able to observe things that more methodical approaches might have overlooked, for example how the subjects had specific personalities and were able to show emotions. One of the most famous results of her research challenges the belief that only humans can make and use tools: she observed one chimpanzee feeding at a termite mound, and taking a twig from a tree and cleaning it from leaves before placing it into the termite holes. The chimpanzee was "fishing" for the ants! Until that point the man was distinguished from the animal kingdom for his ability to build tools, so this discovery led to the observation that "We must now redefine man, redefine tool, or accept chimpanzees as human!".‚Å†
