Grace Hopper (1906-1992) was a computer scientist and a US Navy read admiral. Even as a kid she was curious: when she decided to find out how an alarm clock worked, she dismantled seven before her mom found out what she was doing. Growing up she got degrees in maths and physics, but when she tried to enlist for WWII she was told that not only she was too old and skinny but also that her knowledge was useless for the war effort. So she joined the reserves. There she started working with mainframe computers, and she wrote a compiler that converted English terms into machine code understood by computers. This led to the development of COBOL, a programming language still in use today. A US Navy destroyer and a supercomputer are named after her.‚Å†
