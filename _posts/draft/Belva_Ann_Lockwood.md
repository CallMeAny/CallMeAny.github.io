Belva Ann Lockwood (1830-1917) realized she needed a higher education to support herself and her daughter, when her husband died. She tried to apply at Law school: on her first attempt, she was refused with the reason that her gender might have distracted the men; on her second attempt, she was admitted and passed all of her exams, but wasn't awarded the diploma because she was a woman. Early in her life she discovered how she was paid half of what her male counterparts gained, and her status of married/widowed woman didn't help either: after finally managing to practice her profession, she started lobbying in Congress for bills of equal rights and anti discrimination. In 1879 she was sworn in as the first woman of the U.S. Supreme Court bar. She run for presidency of the US in 1884 and 1888, although with virtually no chance to win as women had no right to vote and newspapers were opposing her openly.‚Å†
