Jane Dieulafoy (1851-1916) got married the same year that the Franco-Prussian war began, and when her husband volunteered and was sent to the front she decided to accompany him, wearing the uniform and fighting by his side. This habit of wearing men's clothing (illegal in France but for which she later received special permission, and that she said was only to save time buying ready-made suites) and wearing her hair short came in handy during her travels, it would have been difficult otherwise for a woman like her to travel Muslim countries. That's where she went the end of the war, spending 10 years traveling in Egypt and Morocco with her husband for archaeological and exploration work, although it was only later during trips to Persia that Jane started documenting the travels and works through photographs, illustrations and writing. These documents have been collected and later published. Her most notable work happened in the city of Susa, which used to be capital of Elam and the Acaemenid Empire: together with her husband, she found numerous artifacts and friezes, many of them were shipped back to France to display at the Louvre. Two rooms in the museum contain objects brought back during those missions, and although the transfer of the artifacts caused considerable damage to the finding of Iranian archaeological excavations, the French government honored her with the title of Chevalier of the Legion of Honor. ‚Å†
