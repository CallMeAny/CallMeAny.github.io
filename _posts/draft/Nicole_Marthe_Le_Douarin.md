Nicole Marthe Le Douarin (1930-) intended to study literature, but a talented science teacher awakened her interest in biology. She went on to earn a PhD, but not without difficulties: the university dean tried to stop her as he disapproved of married women on the same faculty with their husbands, and while she was in the end appointed she was not given laboratory space or a budget, and was mostly loaded with teaching duties. Nicole still managed to continue her researches on avian embryos, working on chimeric embryos of chicken and quails. She invented a staining technique of specific cells that would allow her to follow the development of such cells in the embryo, finding out which contribution to the growth was given by which original embryo. This enabled her to study the development of higher animal nervous system and immune systems.‚Å†
For this she was admitted in multiple highly regarded scientific societies and received many awards.‚Å†
