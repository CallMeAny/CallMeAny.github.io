Comandanta Ramona (1959-2006) was a Zapatista revolutionary who became a symbol of equality and dignity for indigenous and impoverished women. Her activism started when a new trade agreement allowed foreign companies to increase their presence in Mexico. Indigenous people saw their culture being threatened and the lands that gave them subsistence being overstressed. Women, until then ignored by politics as a irrelevant minority, took action: Ramona helped write the Revolutionary Women's Law, helping emancipating women from the antiquated cultural and sexist norms. The influence of leaders like Ramona became so significant that the Zapatista Army of National Liberation ended up being composed by one third of female personnel.‚Å†
