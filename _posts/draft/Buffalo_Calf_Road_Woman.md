Buffalo Calf Road Woman (~1844-1879) was a Northern Cheyenne woman who became a legend by turning around the retreat of the Cheyennes during the Battle of the Rosebud: the warriors were fleeing the battle, leaving Chief Comes in Sight wounded on the ground. When Buffalo Calf Road Woman saw him she turned around and rode full speed to him, grabbing him and bringing him to safety. Upon seeing this, the warriors raised again, ending up in defeating General Crook and his forces. In her honor, the Cheyennes call this battle "The Fight Where the Girl Saved Her Brother". She also participated on the Battle of Little Bighorn, and after 100 years of silence the Cheyenne storytellers decided to share their stories, speaking of how it was Buffalo Calf Road Woman who knocked Custer off his horse before he died.‚Å†
