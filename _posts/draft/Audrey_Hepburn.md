Audrey Hepburn (1929-1993) started her career studying ballet, and then performed as chorus girl in West End musical productions. She became a star when she acted in Roman Holiday: she became the first actress to to win an Oscar, a Golden Globe Award, and a BAFTA Award for a single performance. But before becoming a star, she used her dancing talent to collect money to support the Dutch resistance during WWII, despite her father being a Nazi supporter.‚Å†
Audrey was a style icon, representing a slightly more androgynous alternative to other contemporary ideals that were more curvy and sexual: she kept short hair, thick eyebrows and "gamine" look that was easy for women to emulate. After retiring from the movie industry, Audrey dedicated her time to humanitarian activities, for example collaborating with UNICEF and becoming a Goodwill Ambassador.‚Å†
