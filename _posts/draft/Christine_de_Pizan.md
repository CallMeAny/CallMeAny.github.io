Christine de Pizan (1364-1430) was a poet and author at the court of the French king and dukes. She was born in Venice, and moved to King's Charles V court when her dad was invited there as astrologer. Christine's husband died of plague, and she turned to writing in an attempt to support her family. She became a prolific creator of love ballads, and caught the favor of wealthy patrons. Her skills in managing patronages during turbulent political times made her the first professional woman of letters in Europe. She wrote tales in answer to famous author's portraying women as immoral and vulgar seducers, and books on women's contribution to society and to teach women how to cultivate useful qualities. She crated a dialogue in which she argues that stereotypes of women can only be sustained if women are prevented from entering the conversation at all. ‚Å†
