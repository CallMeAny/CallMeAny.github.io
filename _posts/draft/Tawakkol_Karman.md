Tawakkol Karman (1979-) grew up near Taiz, in Yemen, and in a family of lawyers and journalists she graduated in commerce and in political science. Tawakkol became internationally known in 2011 as the public face of the Yemeni uprising during the Arab Spring, and she was called the Iron Woman and the Mother of the Revolution. In the same year she was one of the recipient of the Nobel Prize for Peace thanks to her non violent struggle for safety of women and women participation in peace-building work. In her country she had been advocating for press freedom since 2005, which evolved in weekly protests in 2007: she is the co-founder of the human rights group Women Journalists Without Chains, and has seen her requests to legally create a newspaper and a radio station rejected by the government, and the discontinuation of a SMS news service that belonged to the group.‚Å†
She advocated for female rights, bringing attention to Yemeni girls getting denied food in favor of boys, high female illiteracy rates, and child marriages. On national television she swapped the traditional full-covering niqab in favor of more a colorful hijab showing her face: her point is that full coverage is cultural and not dictated by Islam.‚Å†
