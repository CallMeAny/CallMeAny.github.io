Sarojini Naidu (1879-1949) was known as the Nightingale of India, thanks to her work as a poet. She started writing when she was 12 years old, and prominent personalities loved her work, both the children's poems and the ones on topics like patriotism, romance and tragedy. During her studies in England she worked as a suffragette, and after this she got close to the Indian movement for independence from the British. She became part of the nationalist movement and started following the ideas of Mahatma Gandhi. During her political career she became the President of the Indian National Congress and also the first woman to hold the office of Governor of the United Provinces.‚Å†
