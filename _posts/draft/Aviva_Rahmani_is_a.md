Aviva Rahmani is a performance and conceptual artist. One of her early projects was a collaboration for "Ablutions", a feminist performance about rape where women bathed in eggs, blood and clay and where finally wrapped in a sheet while a soundtrack of women telling the details of their rapes played continuously. She then became an ecological artist, with pieces that could be the restoration of landscapes to museum venues collecting paintings, sounds and photographs. For her approach, she merges science with aesthetics, for example with her work "Trigger Points, Tipping Points" where she displays satellite imagery with warnings on the changes induced by climate change on the global landscape. She manages to put the topics of class, power and justice in the discussion about climate change, which is not a usual approach. For her recent work, she used the internet, to spare the pollution that would have come from flying around.‚Å†
