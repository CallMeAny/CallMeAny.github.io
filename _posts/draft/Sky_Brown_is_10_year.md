Sky Brown is 10 years old, and she is a skateboarder, surfer and dancer. However, her main focus is skateboard: she is aiming to attend the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo as part of the UK skateboarding team. It will be the first time the sport will be part of the Olympics, and she wants to qualify "to show every girl that you can do everything." Older boys used to talk her down, but she didn't let them stop her: the result is that in 2016, she became the youngest competitor in the Vans United States Open Pro Series.⁠
