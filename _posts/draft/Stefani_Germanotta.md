Stefani Germanotta (1986-), better known as Lady Gaga, learnt to play piano at age 4 and with her talent could soon play music by ear. She decided to drop out from university to focus on her musical career, and with 27 million albums sold (as of 2016), the Facebook page titled "Stefani Germanotta you will never be famous" made by some bullies during her school time now looks ridiculous. Her music is based on electronic dance, but soon incorporated from many different styles, like pop and rock inspired by David Bowie and Queen. That's where her name comes from, from the Queen's song "Radio Gaga". She worked hard to get her work recognized, and when she finally became a star she did it so that everybody would hear about her: not only her music made her famous, but also her outrageous fashion choices, like the infamous dress made out of meat, or the prosthetic implants she claims are always been inside her and grow when she is inspired. She proved to be a great performance artist and talented even in acting, for example in American Horror History and in the movie A Star is Born, for which she got nominated for best actress and the soundtrack she wrote won best original song.‚Å†
