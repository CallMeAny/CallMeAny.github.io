Dorrit Black (1891-1951) attended art school in South Australia and in Sydney, working in watercolors and later in oils. During her studies, she got influenced to use bold geometrical pattern and harmonious color schemes, and from her trips to London and Paris she brought back to Australia modernist and mostly cubist influences. Her work was exposed at the Macquire Galleries in Sydney, one of the six one-woman shows that featured her work. She established the Modern Art Center in Sydney, the first gallery in Australia to devote itself to modernism and one of the first galleries to be established by a woman. Women were the ones who introduced modernism to Australia, and Dorrit is described as the prime force educating Australia in the appreciation of modern art.‚Å†
