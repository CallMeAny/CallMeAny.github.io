Melba Liston (1926-1999) got her first trombone when she was 7 years old. She learned how to play it mostly by herself, with her grandfather teaching her spirituals and folks songs. At age 8 she was already good enough to perform a solo act in a local radio station. During her school years she played in all-female bands, and in the 40s she started to play in big bands and became the first woman trombonist to do so. At first she performed as supporting voice, and only after a lot of encouragement she started playing as a featured voice. She toured with big artists like Billie Holiday, but soon left and dedicated herself to teaching because she didn't like the road life and the indifference of the audience and even of the producers to which she always had to prove herself. However, she always spoke of support and camaraderie from the male musicians. She turned her career to making arrangements for mid-sized and big bands, and although not widely known by the most she is highly regarded in the jazz community as a trailblazer.‚Å†
