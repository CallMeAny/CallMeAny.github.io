Yi So-yeon (1978-) is the first Korean to fly in space, visiting the ISS where she performed experiments, some of them especially designed to study effects of microgravity on Asian somatic traits. She got a PhD in biotech systems, but couldn't attend the award ceremony because of her training commitments in Russia. She spent 10 days in space as "spaceflight participant", and experienced a ballistic re-entry when her Soyuz capsule malfunctioned. After retiring from the Korean Astronaut Program, So-yeon studied for an MBA and joined the Association of Spaceflight Professionals.‚Å†
