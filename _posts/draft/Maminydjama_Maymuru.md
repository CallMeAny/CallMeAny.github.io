Maminydjama Maymuru (1997-) is the first Aboriginal model taking part to the Miss World Australia, where she reached the national finals. As a model, she goes by the name of Magnolia. She belongs to the indigenous community of Yirrkala in the Northern Territory of Australia, and was spotted by a scout in 2014, but at first she didn't accept the offer, preferring to continue her education. It is in 2016 that she reached the finals in the contest of Miss World Australia.‚Å†
