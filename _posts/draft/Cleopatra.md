Cleopatra (69-30 BC) was the last pharaoh of the Kingdom of Egypt: after her death Egypt became a province of the Roman Empire. In contrast with the previous rulers of her dynasty, she learnt the Egyptian language and she was seen by the population as the reincarnation of the goddess Isis. She always had to share the reign with relatives, but thanks to her close relationships with Roman Emperors Julius Caesar and later Mark Anthony she always managed to be really close to the center of power. She was also quite dangerous for the Romans, because she had a large navy, a powerful army and a reign rich in resources. However at some point Rome saw her as too powerful and moved war: after losing her last battle, she committed suicide to preserve her honor.‚Å†
