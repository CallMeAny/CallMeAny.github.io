Petra Herrera (1887-1916) took part in the Mexican Revolution by joining the forces of General Francisco Villa disguised as a man. With the name of Pedro Herrera she could keep her disguise for quite some time, using tricks like pretending to shave her face every morning as to avoid questions about facial hair. She was an excellent leader, and reached the rank of captain leading a brigade of 200 men. She even had some victories, but after revealing her real identity Villa refused to give her military credit and didn't permit her to serve as a general. Therefore, Petra left Villa's forces and formed her own all-female brigade, in which she commanded over 1000 women. She is unofficially credited with the take of the city of Torreon, but this didn't prevent her army to be dissolved by superior orders. Petra became a spy, working in a canteen in the state of Chihuahua: her actions become a bit foggy here, but reports agree that she got shot by a group of drunken bandits, and although she survived the attack she later died of infected wounds.‚Å†
