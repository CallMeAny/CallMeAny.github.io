Carla Del Ponte (1947-) is born in Switzerland, and therefore fluently speaks four languages. She studied to obtain a Master of Laws. In her early career she became known for breaking a money laundry operation of the Sicilian Mafia, and subsequently needing round-the-clock protection after a bomb destined to kill her was discovered in her house. From 1999 she became Chief Prosecutor of two United Nations international criminal law tribunals, for the war crimes committed in ex-Yugoslavia and Rwanda. After her retirement from prosecutor she became Swiss ambassador in Argentina, and later became a member of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic.⁠
