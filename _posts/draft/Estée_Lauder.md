Est√©e Lauder (1908-2004) co-founded the well known cosmetic company. She was born in New York from Hungarian-Jewis immigrants, and she learnt how to conduct business working at the family's hardware store. Her interest in beauty products sparkled when she started helping her uncle, who was a chemist: she started selling his creams to her friends, and the products were so good the business soon flourished!‚Å†
