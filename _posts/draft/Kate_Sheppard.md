Kate Sheppard (1848-1934) is one of the main figures that led New Zealand to be the first country with universal suffrage. In one of her first speeches, she left journalists impressed by the strength that public speaking done by a woman could have. She was working on petitions to prevent women being employed as barmaids and to outlaw the sale of alcohol to children: when her work was discarded, she became convinced that politicians would continue to ignore petitions from women as long as women could not vote. She got a lot of support from women in the Temperance Union, who believed that women's suffrage could also help with alcohol prohibition and promote child and family welfare. However, Kate's point of view was more general, and she stated that "all that separates, whether of race, class, creed, or sex, is inhuman, and must be overcome".‚Å†
