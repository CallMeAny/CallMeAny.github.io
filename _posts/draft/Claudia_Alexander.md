Claudia Alexander (1959-2015) was a scientist specialized in geophysics and planetary science. She worked at NASA's JPL: she coordinated the plasma wave instrument onboard of the Galileo spacecraft, and as project manager she overlooked its final descent into Jupiter. She helped coordinate the Cassini mission to Saturn, and her last project was serving as project manager and researcher for the Rosetta mission, in which a probe has been sent to land on a comet. As a kid, Claudia didn't want to be a scientist, she wanted instead to be a journalist. But her parents pushed her to become an engineer, so that's the path she followed. Moving from engineering to science happened when she started working and she used to sneak over to the scientific ward, where she discovered she was good at that job and she actually really enjoyed it.‚Å†
