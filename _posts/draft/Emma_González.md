Emma Gonz√°lez (1999-) survived a shooting at her high school. In response, just three days after she gave a speech during a rally for gun control: "We call B.S." she said. She was also present at the March for Our Lives protest, where she spoke for six minutes, the exact length of the Parkland shooting, mentioning all the victims by name.‚Å†
