Matilde Montoya (1859-1939) was the first female physician in Mexico. Her mom encouraged her to study gynecology and obstetrics, and at age 16 she became a midwife. With her impressive professional record she applied to the school of medicine, where she was accepted in 1882. She faced a lot of criticism from other men in that male dominated field, but her ability was so good that she was granted a scholarship. She earned her doctorate in 1887, becoming a surgeon and obstetrician.‚Å†
