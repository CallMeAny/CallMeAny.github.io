Joy Lofthouse (1923-2017) saw in a magazine an ad that was seeking women to learn how to fly for the Air Transport Auxiliary, in 1943. Out of 2000 applicants, Joy, who had never even driven a car, was among the 17 who were chosen. Her job was to deliver aircraft from the factories where they were made to the airfields where they were to be flown by the Royal Air Force pilots. During her career, she was able to fly 38 different types of aircraft, and in 2015 at the age of 92 and for the first time on over 70 years, she flew a Spitfire to commemorate V Day. She says that the Spitfire is "the nearest thing to having wings of your own and flying".‚Å†
