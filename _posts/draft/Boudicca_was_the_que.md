Boudicca was the queen of a British Celtic tribe who led an uprising against the occupying forces of the Roman Empire. Boudicca's territory was recognized as an independent ally of Rome, but when her husband the king died his properties were sized and his reign annexed, and she and her daughters were abused. Enraged Boudicca led a revolt: she destroyed modern Colchester, and left Verulanium and modern London burning. The Romans didn't have enough men to face the revolt, and had to evacuate Londinium. This crisis almost convinced Emperor Nero to completely abandon Britain, and only a fortunate victory of outnumbered Roman forces allowed him to regain control. It is said that Boudicca might have poisoned herself after the failure, and she is considered a British folk hero.‚Å†
