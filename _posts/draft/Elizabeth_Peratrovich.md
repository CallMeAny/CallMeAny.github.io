Elizabeth Peratrovich (1911-1958) was an American civil rights activist, and Gran President of the Alaska Native Sisterhood. Part of the Tlingit nation, she became concerned about racial discrimination and inequities after marrying and having children: with her family she moved to Juneau, and became one of the first indigenous families to live in a non-native neighborhood and whose kids went into public schools. In Juneau Elizabeth was looking for lawmakers that could effect change, but even there she found extensive social and racial discrimination against Alaska native people. With her husband, she started to lobby Alaska lawmakers, the governor, and others to advocate for the passage of anti-discrimination legislation, bringing the issue up to the Aslaska Senate, where Elizabeth testified with a passionate speech. Her activities led to Alaska becoming the first territory to end segregation laws, nearly 20 years before the US Congress passed the Civil Rights Act. In 2020, the United States Mint released a $1 gold coin inscribed with Elizabeth's likeness in honor of her historic achievements.‚Å†
