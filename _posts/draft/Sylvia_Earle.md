Sylvia Earle (1935-) is a marine biologist and explorer. She has been a National Geographic explorer since 1998, and Time Magazine nominated her as the first Hero for the Planet in the same year. After getting her doctorate in phycology (the study of algae), she applied to join the Tektite Project, a submerged installation that allowed scientists to live underwater for several weeks. She was denied participation to the program, but she was selected to lead the first all-female team of aquanauts in Tektite II. She set the women's record for deep dive, reaching 381 meters with a pressurized suit, and thanks to her work in deep waters she is sometimes called "Her Deepness". With her husband she started designing, operating and giving consultations on robotic subsea and deep-dive systems. During her time as Chief Scientist at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, she was called to determine the environmental damage caused by the destruction of Kuwaiti oil wells, and applied her experience also in the Exxon Valdez, Mega Borg and Deepwater Horizon oil spills. ‚Å†
