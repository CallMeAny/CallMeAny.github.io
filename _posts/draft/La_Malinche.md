La Malinche (~1500-1529) was a native woman from the Mexican Gulf, and is known for contributing to the Spanish conquest of the Aztec empire. She was possibly given away to slavery by her mother when her father died, so that her brother could have the rights to heir. During her slavery she learned multiple local languages, and her abilities later enabled her to communicate with the Conquistadors. After the Aztec lost a battle against the Spaniards, she was given as bounty to Cortes, for whom she acted as interpreter, advisor and intermediary and who later chose her as a consort. Her reputation has shifted over time, but always remaining a powerful icon embodying conflicting aspects: from traitor of her own people to quintessential victim to scheming temptress. Still nowadays in Mexico the word "malinchista" means a disloyal compatriot, or a person of a certain culture being attracted to another culture.‚Å†
