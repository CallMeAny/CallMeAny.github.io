Zenobia (240-274 AD) was a queen of the Palmyrene Empire in ancient Syria. She was most probably of Aramean and Arab ancestry. When she was about 14 years old, she was married to Odaenathus, the ruler of the city and of the Roman territories from Black sea to Palestine. Zenobia became a queen after her husband's death, and it is possible that she was involved in his assassination due to her political ambitions. To ensure a smooth transition of power, for a period she continued the politics of her husband, and fostered an intellectual environment open to scholars and philosophers, as well as protecting religious minorities. But then, in 270 AD, Zenobia launched an invasion which brought most of the Roman East under her control, culminating with the annexation of Egypt. She declared her son emperor, and assumed the title of empress for herself. The Romans had to sustain heavy battles before regaining control of the region: she was captured only after a siege to her capital, and was sent in exile to Rome for the rest of her life.‚Å†
