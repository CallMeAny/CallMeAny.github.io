Joan of Arc (~1412-1431) is considered a heroine of France, because the invading English started capitulating after she joined the battlefield in Orléans. It is said that she took a hit at the neck while standing in the trench and holding her banner, but later returned to encourage the final assault to the fortress, and the next day the English lifted the siege. Many commanders were impressed with her performance and supported her, and they followed her suggestions in attacking cities well within enemy territory: the English expected them to try to retake Paris, but the had different plans, and soon the invading army had to start retreating. The participation of Joan in the hostilities turned the Anglo-French conflict into a religious war, also because she used to say that it was visions of the Archangel Michael and other saint figures that inspired her to join the king against the invader. The French feared that any unorthodoxy from her side would be interpreted by the English as her being a sorceress or being possessed by the devil, and ordered a full background check of her without finding anything suspicious. But these are exactly the accusations the English moved against her when they captured her, before burning her as a witch. A later inquiry ordered by the Pope pronounced her innocent, and declared her a martyr.⁠
