Rosa Parks (1913-2005) is known as "the first lady of civil rights" and "the mother of the freedom movement". She was the figure inspiring the Montgomery bus boycott: she refused to leave her seat in the colored section of a bus to a white passenger, after the white section was full. Her arrest resulted in the black community deciding to not take the bus anymore until buses were fully integrated. Carpools were organized instead, and taxis were giving discounted rides. This action resulted in a substantial financial loss for the public transportation company, and after a year the segregated buses of Alabama and Montgomery were declared unconstitutional. This is still nowadays one of the biggest example of pacific civil protest. ‚Å†
