Janna Tamimi (2006-), commonly known as Janna Jihad, began reporting on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict when she was 7 years old, after two of her family members were killed. She has been called The Youngest Journalist in Palestine, and started reporting from the perspective of Palestinian youth growing up amid violence. She used her mom's iPhone to record protests near her home and uploading them to various social media, and then started covering events and marches in Jerusalem and Jordan. Some have criticized her as being a propaganda pawn, but she believes she is living the third Intifada and supports Palestinian resistance, and she was awarded an International Benevolence Award.⁠
