Ginni Rometty (1957-) is the current chair, president, and CEO of IBM, and the first woman to head the company. She started her career in the company in 1981 as a system engineer, and worked also in global sales, marketing, and strategy. She had a big role launching IBM in the service business, when she helped negotiating the acquisition of another company and was then in charge of integrating the newly acquired within the existing teams. In her career she was included in many "Top 50", like most influential people in the world, most powerful women in business and women in tech. However, her work has also been criticized, especially due to layoffs, outsourcing and a long period of revenue decline for the company.‚Å†
