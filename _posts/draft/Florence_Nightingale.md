Florence Nightingale (1820-1910) is known for her service as manager and training of nurses during the Crimean War, and for her writings and use of simple graphics explaining her medical ideas. She professionalized nursing roles for women and founded the first secular nursing school in the world. As a girl she had decided that she wanted to dedicate her life to helping others, but had to fight against the anger of her family die to the expectations of her becoming a wife and mother. When news of the horrific conditions in which the wounded of the Crimean war were being treated reached England, Florence moved there with the volunteer nurses that she had trained, and some nuns. They found overworked medical staff, lack of medicine, and neglected hygiene, resulting often in mass deadly infections. She realized that the extremely poor living conditions were causing the spread of diseases, and brought up suggestions like washing hands, flushing the sewers, improving ventilation. The death toll among wounded soldiers fell from 42% to 2%, and her ideas were implemented in the designs of new hospitals. She was nicknamed "The Lady with the Lamp", due to her angelic presence visiting the wards at night.‚Å†
