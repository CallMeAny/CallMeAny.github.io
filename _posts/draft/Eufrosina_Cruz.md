Eufrosina Cruz (1979-) comes from Oaxaca, Mexico, from a tiny Zapotec village. There the traditional customs are still very much alive, and women are held to their role of submissive hard workers: they are expected to wake up in the middle of the night to gather fuel, tend to the kids, clean the house and prepare food, all while keeping silent and in the shadows when men are around. Girls often can't attend school and are married off at a young age to a men chosen by the father. At the age of 11, Eufrosina decided she didn't want to live like that: she left the village to go study and learn Spanish (her native language is Zapotec), graduated from college with a degree in accounting and obtained a job as a teacher. When she went back to her village. she found everything exactly as she had left it, and decided it was time to change things: she decided to run for mayor, even thought women couldnt vote and political power was exclusively a men's business. Although people spread rumors, ridiculed and threatened her, in 2007 she was allowed in the election, mostly because the ruling family thought that nobody could dare to violate the tradition and vote for a woman. To everybody's surprise, Eufrosina won the election. However, the victory was not accepted, and votes for her were thrown into the trash, while the former mayor stated that "women do not exist here" and "women are create to serve men". Eufrosina addressed human rights organizations and state authorities, and the matter was taken seriously: the law was changed to make sure that women had full access and rights to elections, and many spoke for women's living conditions to be improved. In 2009 Eufrosina was asked to participate in elections for the federal Chamber of Deputies, but she refused inviting the parties to allow local women to do so; in 2010 she became the first indigenous woman to become chair of the local congress in the state of Oaxaca.‚Å†
