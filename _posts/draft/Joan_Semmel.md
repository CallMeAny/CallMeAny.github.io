Joan Semmel (1932-) is a feminist painter, known for large scale self portraits made from her own perspective, so usually looking down on her naked body, using luminous colors. She spent years developing her style in Spain, but it was upon her return in New York that she was shocked by the amount of sexualization of women in magazines sold at newsstands. That's when she started painting in a figurative style and incorporated the erotic aspects that made her famous. During a panel on about painting and the legacy of feminism, she stated that "If there aren‚Äôt great celebrated women artists, that's because we have not been celebrating them, but not because they are not there."‚Å†
