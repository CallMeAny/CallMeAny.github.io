General Amaya (fictional, The Dragon Prince) is one of the highest-ranking generals in the army of Katolis. She is deaf and communicates through sing language, translated by her lieutenant for the ones who don't know ASL. She is a skilled lip reader, and her deafness is no problem when leading her soldiers in battle and fighting for her homeland. As fierce as she is as a warrior, she is also caring and loving, and especially to her nephews who are trying to prevent a diplomatic incident from escalating into a war. The representation of disabilities is not common at all in cartoons: General Amaya (together with Toph from The Last Airbender) is one of the first characters fully developed and not portrayed only through her disability.‚Å†
