Annie Easley (1933-2011) was always encouraged by her mom to become whatever she wanted, and to work hard for it. So she focused on her education, and went to college. Thanks to this, when black people had to pass a literacy test to be allowed to vote, she could help other women prepare for the test. She started studying pharmacy, but in 1955 she applied for a job at NACA (which later became a NASA research lab) and got hired as mathematician and computer engineer. In her career she implemented software used to analyze alternative power technologies, storage batteries and even a program for the Centaur rocket stage. ‚Å†
