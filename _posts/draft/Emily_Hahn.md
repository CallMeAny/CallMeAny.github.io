Emily Hahn (1905-1997) loved reading and writing, and therefore enrolled in the general arts program at university. However, she quickly changed the course to mining, after being prevented from enrolling in a class taken mainly by engineering students. She was the first woman to enroll in that degree, and despite her colleagues and professors being all but enthusiast ("the female mind is incapable of grasping [...] any of the fundamentals of mining taught" said one of her professors!), she graduated in 1926. During her life she traveled a lot, and the letters that she sent to her brother-in-law describing her experiences jumpstarted her career as a writer: when describing her travels across the US dressed as a man, he was secretly forwarding her letters to The New Yorker. She traveled to the Belgian Congo and hiked across Central Africa, before spending a few years in Shanghai: the reason she was giving for these adventures was often "nobody said not to go", and wherever she went she was getting noticed, for example for her pet monkey.‚Å†
All these experiences were put into her writing, and her novels in the 20th century played a significant role in opening up Asia and Africa to the west. Emily is often considered an early feminist, and The New Yorker called her "a forgotten American literary treasure"‚Å†
