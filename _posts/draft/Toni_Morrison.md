Toni Morrison (1931-2019) learnt about heritage and language from her parents, who told her traditional African-American folktales and ghost stories and sung songs. When she moved to New York she became the first black woman senior editor in the fiction department of Random House. During that time she played a vital role in bringing black literature into mainstream. She wrote her first novel waking up at 4am every morning before going to work: it was a story she started developing at university, about a black girl who longed to have blue eyes. She won a Nobel in Literature, the first black woman to get awarded that prize, and a Pulitzer for the first book of her trilogy about African-American history: Beloved, inspired by the true story of an enslaved woman who escaped and when recaptured instead of going back into slavery she killed her daughter but didn't have time to kill herself.‚Å†
