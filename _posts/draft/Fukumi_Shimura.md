Fukumi Shimura (1924-) is a Japanese textile artist. She started creating kimonos in 1958, along the tsumugi (pongee weaving and dyeing) tradition where fibers and fabrics are dyed using natural vegetable pigments. Thanks to her work she won many prizes and was even named Living National Treasure in 1990.⁠
