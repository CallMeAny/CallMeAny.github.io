Jacquotte Delahaye (possibly legend) was a pirate active in the Caribbean sea around 1650. She was Haitian, and turned to piracy after the murder of her father, possibly to sustain the care of her mildly disabled brother. It is said that to escape her pursuers she faked her own death and took on a male identity, under which she lived for many years. When she returned, she became known as "Back form the Dead Red", due to her red hair. She led hundreds of pirates, with which in 1656 she took over a small island, called a freebooter republic. She died years later in a gun fight erupted while defending the island. To note is that Jacquotte's life isn't reported in any source from the period, and stories of her exploits are attributed to a French fiction writer in the 40s.‚Å†
