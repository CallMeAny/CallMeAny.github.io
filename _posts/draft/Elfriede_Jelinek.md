Elfriede Jelinek (1946-) is a playwright and novelist, who won the Nobel Prize in Literature for her works mixing multiple voices to show the absurdity and at the same time the power of clich√©s in society, often focusing on the battle of sexes and on female sexuality. Her mother planned for Elfriede to be a musical talent, tutoring her in multiple instruments. She graduated from the Vienna Conservatory and later studied art history at university, but had to quit due to an anxiety disorder, that led her to self-isolate for a year. That's when she started writing, as a form of therapy. However, she later said that writing was for her always a struggle and she had to battle great inner resistance, but she went through out of a sense of social obligation. When her work gained her the Nobel, she wondered if the main reason of receiving the prize was that she was a woman. She didn't show up for receiving the prize in person, instead sent a video message and revealed how she suffers from social phobia.‚Å†
