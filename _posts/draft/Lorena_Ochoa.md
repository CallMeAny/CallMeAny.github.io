Lorena Ochoa (1981-) is the first Mexican golfer to be ranked number one in the world, and she is considered the best Latin American female golfer of all time. She started playing golf when she was 5 years old, and immediately started winning: she won her first state event when she was 6, and her first national event when she was seven. She attended college, but left after the second year to play professionally. From 2007 to 2010, the year of her retirement, she was the top-ranked female golfer in the world for 158 consecutive and total weeks.‚Å†
