Joanne K Rowling (1965-) was a researcher and secretary for Amnesty International when she first had the idea for the Harry Potter series in 1990. The first book was published in 1997, and in the seven years in between Joanne didn't have an easy life: her mom died and her marriage failed, leaving her depressed and poor. The first manuscript of Harry Potter was rejected by 12 different publishing houses, but Joanne didn't give up and this made her the world first billionaire author. She gave away most of that fortune to charities, but she is still one of the wealthiest people in the world.‚Å† After Harry Potter, her fame diminished: she moved to writing crimes under the unfortunate pen name of Robert Galbraith. This name, the content of the new books and the sharing of controversial opinions about gender issues on her social media estranged her from her fanbase, and got her the label of transphobe.
