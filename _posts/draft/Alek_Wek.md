Alek Wek (1977-) had to run away from Sudan due to the civil war, and arrived in London. There she enrolled in college to major in Fashion Business and Technology. She suffered from psoriasis, but the climate change helped clear her skin problem. A scout discovered her, amazed by her beauty: dark skinned models, so different from the Caucasian standard, were really rare at that time.⁠
