Patty Jenkins (1971-) was supposed to become an environmental scientist. But then she saw the original Superman movie, and she became inspired to follow a career in film. After going to art school, she received film training while working on set for free: she ended up working 10 years as cameraperson. While shooting a Michael Jackson music video, her director of photography suggested she started to learn directing. In 2011 she was hired to direct the sequel to Thor, but soon left over creative differences. She went on to sign as director for the DC Extended Universe, working on Wonder Woman. She became the first female director of an American superhero movie, which went on becoming the biggest domestic opening and then highest-grossing movie by a female director. She worked on the sequel for Wonder Woman, and her strategy of not signing for two movies from the start allowed her to negotiate a salary corresponding to what a male counterpart would get in her same place. The estimated terms of her contract with Warner Bros would be a record-breaking salary for a female filmmaker.‚Å†
