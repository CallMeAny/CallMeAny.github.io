Pussy Riot (founded in 2011) is a feminist punk rock and performance art in Russia. They say anyone can join, and the group usually has between 10 and 20 members, who wear brightly colored balaclavas and use aliases when giving interviews to preserve anonymity. They staged unauthorized guerrilla performances in public, which were filmed and published online as music videos. Topics covered feminism, LGBT rights, opposition to president Vladimir Putin, his policies and his ties to the leadership of the Russian Orthodox Church. Pussy Riot became world-famous when members were arrested after an action outside Moscow's cathedral in which they protested the church support for Putin in the election campaign. The actions were depicted as sacrilegious, and three group members were condemned to prison for hooliganism "motivated by religious hatred". Pussy Riot target both western and Russian audiences, but while the just mentioned case got a lot of attention in the west, especially from human right groups, it was regarded with less sympathy by Russian public opinion. Pussy Riot members continued staging performances, for example during the Sochi Olympics, or with a pitch invasion during the final match of 2018 FIFA world cup.‚Å†
