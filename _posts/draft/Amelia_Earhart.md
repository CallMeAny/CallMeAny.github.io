Amelia Earhart (1897-1937) was a record-setting aviation pioneer and the author of best-selling books about her flying experiences. In 1928 she became a celebrity for being the first female passenger to cross the Atlantic by airplane, and in 1932 she made the transatlantic flight on her own, non-stop, becoming the first woman to achieve that. All of this constantly fighting health issues due that impacted her breathing ability. In 1937 she and her navigator were attempting to circumnavigate the globe, but they disappeared over the central Pacific Ocean, most probably because they run out of fuel.‚Å† üì∑: Underwood (Public domain)
