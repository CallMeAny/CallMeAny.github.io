Mary Somerville (1780-1872) grew up running free in her family's garden, where her mom cultivated vegetables to sell to help sustain the family with the little pay the navy gave her dad. It was her dad who finally decided she needed to learn to read and write, and sent her to boarding school. She fell in love with reading, and spent most of her time in her father's library. But she was soon encouraged to go back to houseworks, and started wondering how unjust it is for women to have a desire for knowledge if it is wrong for them to acquire such knowledge. She managed to continue learning and reading, and thanks to her role of daughter in a well-connected family she attended social events and could hear of politics. That's when she started refusing sugar in her tea, as protest against slavery. After marrying, Mary had freedom to study, although her husband didn't believe in women's capacity to pursue academic interests. But Mary was developing her love for maths, and was extending her studies in astronomy, chemistry, electricity and many more fields, and finding time to publish papers while taking care of her family and kids. She became the tutor of Ada Lovelace, and Ada would often turn to Mary if she had difficulties with a calculation she was working on.‚Å†
