Yoko Ono (1933-) is an artist of multiple talents: singing, songwriting, performance acts, film making. Also she is a peace activist: after marrying John Lennon, they used the honeymoon to stage bed-ins against the war in Vietnam. They invited the press in their room and, while in bed wearing pajamas, they talked about peace. Short afterwards, she sent acorns to the head of many countries in hope they would plant them as a symbol of peace. For long time Yoko was not appreciated by the public: for example, she was blamed for the Beatles breakup. However, after a retrospective, the importance of her work was recognized: her feminist and conceptual works, plus the work on Lennon's memory won her many lifetime achievement awards and different Grammy nominations, one of them actually won.‚Å†
