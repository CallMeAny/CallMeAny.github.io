Alexandra Kollontai (1872-1952) was one of the two women playing a relevant role in the Russian revolution. Daughter of a general, she had a private education because her parents didn't want her to get bad influences in public schools. She liked marxist and feminist ideas, and was the first woman in the Executive Committee of the Petrograd Soviet. When Lenin returned to Russia, Alexandra was a supporter of his proposals, like the immediate end of the war and the political powers to the Soviets. She was also a voice for sexual liberation in a repressive society based on traditional weddings (she married a cousin so that she didn't have to end up in a convenience marriage). She had a great diplomatic career, being the first woman figuring as a ministry and ambassador in the big European countries.‚Å†
