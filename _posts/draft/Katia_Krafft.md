Katia Krafft (1942-1991) was a French volcanologist that pioneered the filming, photographing and recording of volcanoes. She fell in love with volcanoes after seeing a picture of them, and went on studying geology to get into the field. While everybody else was too afraid to get close enough for proper data collection, she approached the edges and the lava flows to get pictures and gas samples. She even rafted on an acid lake to get better data. Katia died when a pyroclastic flow she was observing suddenly changed direction and hit her and her fellow researchers.‚Å†
