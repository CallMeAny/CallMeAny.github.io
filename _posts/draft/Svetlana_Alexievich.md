Svetlana Alexievich (1948-) started her career as a reporter working for local newspapers in Belarus, and after graduating from university she became a corresponded from a literary magazine from Minsk. She specialized in writing stories based on witnesses, based on her conviction that to describe the horrors of the 20th century testimonies were better than fiction. She reported on many dramatic events in Soviet history: WWII, the Afghan war, the fall of the URSS, and the Chernobyl. Thanks to her work, in 2015 she was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, where her writings were described as "a monument to suffering and courage in our time".‚Å†
