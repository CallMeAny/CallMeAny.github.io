Simeona Punsalan Tapang (1922-2015) was also known as Kumander Guerrero, and before the war worked as organizer for the National Assembly of Farmers in the Philippines. When the Imperial Japanese army invaded the country, Simeona learned that women were being kidnapped to become comfort women, so at the age of 19 she decided to join the guerrilla. After a period held in prison by the Japanese, she served as captain in the strongest and most battle-tested squadron of the guerilla, and was soon promoted major, leading several successful combats. After the Japanese had retired, a period of American occupation began: Simeona remained with the resistance, because their members were being arrested and killed rather than being recognized as valid allies that provided war support.‚Å†
