Anna Politkovskaja (1958-2006) grew up in Moscow, where she graduated university in journalism. She became a human right activist writing about social problems and about refugees. In particular her work about the war in Chechnya and the abuses that were happening there made her famous. She was not only writing, but also helped evacuation of civilians and was involved in negotiations for hostages release. Due to her work she faced death threats, detention, torture and poisoning. She was later found dead in the elevator of her own block of flats. In her honor an award is given out yearly to women that work in conflict zones at their own risk to defend human rights.‚Å†
