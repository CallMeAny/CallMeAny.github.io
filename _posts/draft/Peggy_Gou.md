Peggy Gou (1991-) was born in South Korea, where she started taking classical piano lessons. Aged 14, her parents sent her to London to study English, and she decided to stay to study Fashion. She was taught to be a DJ by a Korean friend: she completed her first track in 2014, and played it at the opening of the Style Icon Awards. Her music career took up, and she became the first Korean DJ to play in Berlin's most exclusive nightclub. She plays more than hundred live gigs in a year, and has covered most of the biggest festivals worldwide. She launched her own independent record label, and also a fashion label. She has been on the cover of Vogue Germany, and in 2019 Forbes named her as one of the Asian leaders, pioneers and entrepreneurs under age 30.‚Å†
