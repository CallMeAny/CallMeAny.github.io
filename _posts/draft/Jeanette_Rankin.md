Jeanette Rankin (1880-1973) was the first woman to hold federal office in the United States, being elected to the US House of Representatives as a Republican from Montana. Both of her terms (in 1916 and 1940) corresponded with the start of US military intervention in the World Wars: Jeanette was a pacifist, and she first opposed declaring war on Germany, and then was the only one voting against declaring war on Japan. She was a suffragette, lobbying for women rights, and eventually introducing the legislation that became the 19th Amendment, where unrestricted voting rights are granted to women in all the US. To date, Jeanette is the only woman ever elected to Congress from Montana.‚Å†
