Marina Abramović (1946-) is a Serbian performance artist, and her work explores body, mind, endurance and feminism art, often inviting the observers to take part to her performances. In one of her earliest works she played the Russian game, rhythmically tapping a knife in between her fingers, with 20 knives, changing knife every time she cut herself. In her most famous work she stood passively as the audience was allowed to use different objects on her. At first, people were cautious, but as she remained still they become more aggressive. When after 6 hours she stood up, everybody run away to avoid confrontation. Her body was abused, attacked and degraded in ways that she described as "Madonna, mother, and whore." One of her less physically violent works is The Artist is Present, in which she sat in front on an empty chair and silently kept eye contact with whoever sat in that chair, for 736.5 hours.⁠
