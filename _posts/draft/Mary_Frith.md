Mary Frith (1584-1659), gained her nickname as Moll Cutpurse due to her occupation: she was a notorious pickpocker in the London underworld. Her uncle tried to reform her by sending her to New England, but she jumped overboard before the ship could sail off. She used to wear men's clothes, smoke pipe and swear, and she loved breading mastiffs. She defied convention by performing in public playing the lute and singing at the Fortune Theater. She developed her career to end up being a pimp and a fence (acquiring and re-selling stolen goods), and not only providing ladies for men, but also respectable male lovers for middle-class wives.‚Å†
