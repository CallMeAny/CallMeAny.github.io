Beatrix Potter (1866-1943) developed her love for flora and fauna during her solitary childhood holidays in Scotland. She became well respected in the field of mycology thanks to her watercolors and studies of mushrooms. She moved from natural scientist to full time children's book author in her thirties, after her self-published book The Tale of Peter Rabbit became highly successful. During her life, she bought multiple farms to preserve the landscape she loved, and she became a prize-winning sheep breeder.‚Å†
