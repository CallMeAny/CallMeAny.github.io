Iris Apfel (1921-) is a businesswoman, interior designer and fashion icon. She developed her knowledge by being the assistant of interior designers and illustrators, and then with her husband she opened a textile firm. From 1950 to 1992 she also took part in multiple design restoration projects, including working at the White House for nine US presidents. Her work has been recognized in multiple ways: from a Barbie doll from Mattel, to becoming a visiting professor at University of Texas at age 90, to having an exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York as first ever living person who isn't a designer.‚Å†
