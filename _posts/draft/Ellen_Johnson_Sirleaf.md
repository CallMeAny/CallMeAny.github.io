Ellen Johnson Sirleaf (1938-) is the first elected female head of state in Africa, serving as President of Liberia from 2006 to 2018. She got married at 17 and started working as a housekeeper, but after studying at the College of West Africa and continuing education at Harvard University she moved back to Liberia working as Deputy Minister of Finances under President Tolbert. When Tolber was executed after a coup d'etat she fled to the US, but she stayed in politics, facing threats of imprisonment for speaking against the regime and collecting funds for National Patriotic Front of Liberia during the first civil war. She returned to Liberia in 1997 to run as presidential candidate but she had to flee to exile again after being accused of treason. After the second civil war she served as head of the Governance Reform Commission, and run for President in 2005. After some disputes, she was officially announced as winner of the elections. Ellen vowed to make reduction of the national debt and controlling future borrowings, and she promoted national peace, security, unity and reconciliation after the 20 year long war. She won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2011, in recognition of her efforts to bring women into the peacekeeping process. ‚Å†
