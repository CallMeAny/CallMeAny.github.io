Rumiko Takahashi (1957-) started her career by doodling on school books. During university she enrolled in a manga school, and she started publishing her comics. But life was not always easy: she had troubles meeting deadlines, so the chapters of her stories were published sporadically. Also, she lived in a shared apartment, so small that her sleeping room was often a closet. She kept working on short stories and more involved projects, while her work started getting translated into animated series. Thanks to her style, her work got translated to English and to many other languages, and even if she feels that due to cultural differences not every scene can be fully exported she enjoys the success.‚Å†
