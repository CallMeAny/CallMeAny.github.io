Yukie Chiri (1903-1922) was born into an Ainu family, an ethnic minority that was forced to relocate due to native Japanese people immigrating in the Hokkaido region. In an attempt to assimilating the Ainu, the Japanese outlawed and stigmatized their culture: Chiri, living with her grandmother who loved to tell Ainu tales, was one of the last witnesses of their oral literature that was slowly disappearing. Thanks to her upbringing in Japanese school, Chiri was fluent in Ainu and Japanese language, and after her mentor explained her the value in preserving the Ainu folklore and traditions, she dedicated her life to recording and translating the tales. She used romaji, s latin script to represent Japanese language and sounds, and her book remains the most important source for the Ainu culture today.⁠
