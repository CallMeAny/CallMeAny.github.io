Haben Girma (1988-) is a disability rights advocate and the first deafblind graduate of Harvard Law School. Haben wasn't born deafblind, but a progressive condition beginning in her childhood lead her to losing vision and hearing: thanks to technology, she was able to graduate from high school and later from college, in which she started her advocating for legal right to accommodations in the school cafeteria. Haben says she became a lawyer in part to help increase access to books and other digital information for persons with disabilities, and now works for the development of accessible digital services: she says that "digital information is just one and zeroes, it can be converted in any kind of format".â�
