Emma Goldman (1869-1940) got interested into anarchism after the Haymarket Affair, in which a peaceful rally demonstrating for an 8h workday got disrupted by somebody throwing a bomb at the police, resulting in multiple deaths and injured. She became a prominent supporter on anarchist philosophy, on topics like women's rights and social issues. Thousands went to hear her ideas. She was arrested multiple times for "inciting to riot" and distributing information about birth control. She conspired against the draft at the end of WWI, and was arrested again and then deported to Russia. At first the was supportive of the October Revolution, but changed her opinion when she realized how violent was the repression against independent voices.⁠
