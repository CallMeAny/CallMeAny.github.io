Marlene Dumas (1953-) is regarded as one of the most influential painters active nowadays. She started painting when she was about 20 years old, to express her political concerns and reflections on her identity as white woman of Afrikaans descent. She uses polaroid photographs as reference for her works, together with magazines and pornographic material. Her paintings are often portraits, but instead of representing the people she aims to represent their emotional state.‚Å†
