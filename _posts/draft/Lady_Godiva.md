Lady Godiva (?-~1070) was an English noblewoman, Countess of Mercia. The legend says that her husband was abusing the people of Coventry with exaggerated taxation, and Lady Godiva had begged him again and again to remove the tolls. He kept refusing until one day, tired of her requests, he told her that he would accept if she would strip naked and ride on a horse through the streets of the town. Lady Godiva didn't think twice about that, and devised a plan: she issued a proclamation that everybody should stay indoor and shut their windows, and then she really rode through town covered only in her long hair. Some interpretations say that in fact naked meant either in undergarment as a penitent, or stripped of jewellery that was symbol of her upper class, but historians say that in that era "naked" was really only used to mean "without any clothing whatsoever".‚Å†
