Ester Ledeck√° (1995-) is the first person to win two gold medals in separate disciplines at the same Winter Olympics: in 2018 in Pyeongchang, she won the super-G in alpine skiing, and parallel giant slalom in snowboarding. First came the skiing competition, which she entered ranked 49th in the world: rumored to be competing with borrowed skis, much to her own surprise she managed to finish 0.01 ahead of the defending gold medalist. She then went on for the event that was supposed to be her best shot, snowboarding, and slayed the competition placing first again! During the press conference after the ski race she decided to keep on her ski mask, her trademark.‚Å†
