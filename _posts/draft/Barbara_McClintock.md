Barbara McClintock (1902-1992) got her bachelor in biology, and went on to study genetics at Cornell University. At the time, women could not major in genetics there, so formally her MSc and PhD are awarded in botany. But her research took place in the Plant Breeding Department, and that's the field where she did her most relevant discoveries: she studied reproduction in maize, and developed techniques to visualize maize chromosomes. She used microscopic analysis to demonstrate many fundamental genetic ideas, like genetic regulation (one of the mechanisms with which chromosomes exchange information). She managed to create a genetic map for maize, linking regions of the chromosome to physical traits. Thanks to the theory of transposition, used to prove that genes are responsible for turning physical characteristics on and off, she was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, and she is the only woman to hold the honor unshared in that category.‚Å†
