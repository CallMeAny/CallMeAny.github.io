Sofia Ionescu (1920-2008) was the first female neurosurgeon in the world. She was born in Romania, and her interest in medicine started when one of her friends introduced her to her father, who happened to be a doctor. After a friend died of infection following a brain surgery, she decided to apply to medical school in Bucharest, supported by her mother. In her first internship she studied ophthalmology, then spent a year in a poorly equipped clinic during a typhus epidemic, and then volunteered to take care of Soviet prisoners, entering surgical service and gaining experience mostly in amputations. During the war, Bucharest was bombed, and she was forced to perform an emergency brain surgery on an injured boy, due to lack of more trained medical staff. She became certified in 1945, and went on forming the first neurological team of Romania, later called "the Golden Team", and performed for almost 50 years before her failing vision forced her to retire.‚Å†
