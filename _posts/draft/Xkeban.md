Xkeban (legend) was a girl from the Yucatan peninsula. She and her sister Utz-colel where the most beautiful girls in the village, but while Xkeban kept tending to the poor, the sick and those in need, Utz-colel was superior and cruel. However, the village adored Utz-colel and saw her virtuous for being celibate, while the sister was treated poorly due to her promiscuous behavior. The village wanted to exile Xkeban, but let her stay so they could further humiliate her. When Xkeban died, flowers with sweet fragrance grew around her grave. Utz-colel believed that her dead body would smell better because of her purity, but upon her death her corpse had an unbearable smell. For her jealousy and rage, she became the demon Xtabay, while Xkeban was transformed in the beautiful xtabent√∫n flower.‚Å†
