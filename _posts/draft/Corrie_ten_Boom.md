Corrie ten Boom (1892-1983) was part of a Dutch watchmaking family, who during WWII helped Jewish people escape from the Nazis by hiding them in her home. The family of Corrie was part of the Reformed Church, and there they learned that the Jews were precious to God: this was one of the motivations for helping them during the war, as "in this household, God's people are always welcome." Their work providing refuge to Jewis people became known to the Dutch resistance movement, which sent an architect to build a secret room in the house where the Jews could hide when Germans were sweeping the neighborhood. Additional help came through connections made with charitable work, putting them in contact with a men in charge of the ration cards and food coupons office, who provided them with enough cards to give out to all the Jews they met, helping them not to starve. However, not everybody agreed with this work: an informant told the Nazis about the family secret activities, and even though the secret room hiding Jews and resistance workers remained undiscovered, material of the Resistance and extra ration cards were found at their home. After being held in prison, they were sent to a political concentration camp, where after the daily work they held worship service with a Bible they had managed to smuggle in. Corrie was released after almost a year of prison, and probably due to a clerical error: a week after her release, all the women in her age group were sent to the gas chambers.‚Å†
Corrie returned home and opened her doors to the mentally disabled that were hiding in fear of execution, and after the war set up a rehabilitation center for concentration-camp survivors and sheltered Dutch who had collaborated with the Germans. She was an example of unfailing charity, among others meeting and forgiving two Germans that were cruel to her and her sister during their time in prison.‚Å†
