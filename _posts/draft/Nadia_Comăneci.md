Nadia Comăneci (1961-), from Romania, is the first gymnast to be awarded a perfect score of 10.0 at the Olympic Games. This happened in Montreal Summer Olympics in 1976, and in the same Games she was awarded six more perfect 10s. Her mom enrolled her in gymnastic classes because she was so full of energy that she was difficult to manage, and at the age of 7 she entered an experimental gymnastic school where they trained athletes from a young age. She scored her famous perfect 10 at the uneven bars: it was so improbable to receive this score that the manufacturer of the scoreboard didn't implement the number, and therefore the result appeared as "1.00", the only way for the judges to show her result.⁠
