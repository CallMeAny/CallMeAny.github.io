Alice Munro (1931-) published her first story while studying English and journalism, and working a few side jobs. Her writing has a small town settings, and instead of developing a plot the stories focus on a moment of enlightening. Her early work was about girls growing up, and then moved to the ambiguities of life in middle age and the elderly. Thanks to her style she won a Nobel Prize in Literature in 2013.‚Å†
