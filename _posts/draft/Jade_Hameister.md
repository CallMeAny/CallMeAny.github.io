Jade Hameister (2001-) is an Australian that took inspiration for her adventures during her trek to Everest Base Camp at age 12. She started her own quest, the Polar Hat Trick: in 2016 she skied to the North Pole, in 2017 she traversed the Greenland icecap, and in 2018 she skied to the South Pole. South Pole and Greenland were adventures that she completed alone, unassisted. She covered over 1300 km, for almost four months on the ice.⁠
