Majlinda Kelmendi (1991-) won the first gold medal ever for Kosovo at an Olympic Games. The country has been recognized by the International Olympic Committee in 2014, and Majlinda went at the 2016 Olympics in Rio as flagbearer. She has been a successful judoka for years, winning a gold medal at the World Junior Championships in 2009, and consistently winning against the best athletes in her category. She had already participated in the London Olympics in 2012: Kosovo wasn't recognized at the time, and she wasn't allowed to participate as an independent athlete, so she took part to the games with the Albanian delegation.‚Å†
