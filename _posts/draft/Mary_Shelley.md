Mary Shelley (1797-1851) was a prolific writer, and a professional editor. She is best known for being the author of Frankenstein, and she described the period in which she was writing it as when she stepped out of childhood into life. It all happened during a rainy summer: Mary was spending time with friends on a cottage on a lake, but the rain often forced them to stay home. So they started entertaining each other with ghosts stories, until somebody had the idea that everyone had to write a story from scratch. For days Mary didn't know what to write, but after a discussion about the principles of life she started wondering whether galvanism could reanimate a corpse, and that's when the story started forming. It was supposed to be just a short tale, but it was so good that her friend encouraged her to expand it and make it her first novel.‚Å†
