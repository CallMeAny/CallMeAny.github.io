Amy Hughes (1856-1923) was working as a superintended for Queen's Nurses when she was asked to visit a local school to give advice about nutrition. She quickly realized that minor health problems were resulting in a lot of missed school days for the pupils: she organized for the Queen's nurses to be able to visit the schools and help with those problems, and is credited to be the first school nurse in the UK.‚Å†
