Beulah Louise Henry (1887-1973) was given the nickname of Lady Edison for her many inventions: in 1937 she was known as America's leading feminine inventor, and in her career she received 49 patents for a total of 110 inventions. She was a creative and curious child, and used to look at things and point out what was wrong with them, and how she would have changed them. Her first patent was at age 25, for a vacuum ice cream freezer. She then moved to New York, founding two companies and serving as consultant for all other companies manufacturing her work: in the big city she lived in hotels, belonged to many scientific societies and, surprising for the time, never married. Her inventions cover many categories, but tend to focus on improving women's quality of life (she invented an hair curler, a bobbinless sewing machine, a snap-on parasol to match patterns with the owner's dress,...) and toys (she came up with a method to inflate dolls instead of stuffing them).‚Å†
