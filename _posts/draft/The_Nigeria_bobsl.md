The Nigeria bobsled team was first established in 2016 by Seun Adigun, who is an athlete specialized in the 100 meters hurdles. In 2017 they qualified to be the first Nigerians at the Winter Olympics, and first Africans in bobsled at the Winter Olympics. They competed in the 2-women competition, as an entirely self-funded team, who at first trained in a sled made out of wood. Seun was the team driver, and the brakewomen were Ngozi Onwumere (also a track athlete) and Akuoma Omeoga.‚Å†
