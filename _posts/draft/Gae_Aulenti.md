Gae Aulenti (1927-2012) was an Italian architect whose work spans from industrial design to furniture to graphics, lighting and interior design. She decided to study architecture in spite of her parents hoping she would become a nice society girl. She designed for big names like Fiat, Pirelli and Louis Vuitton. In 1981 she was chosen to turn a train station into a museum, and her work led to commissions for even bigger progets like the Pompidou in Paris.‚Å†
