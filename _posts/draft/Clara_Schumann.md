Clara Schumann (1819-1896) is regarded as one of the most distinguished pianists of the Romantic era. She had been trained by her father with one hour lesson and two hours practice every day, and showed to be a prodigy. This gave her success in the most important cities of Europe, but came at expense of her general education. She married composer Robert Schumann, and was chosen to premiere in public his works and works of their close friend Johannes Brahms. ⁠
