Gabrielle Bonheur "Coco" Chanel (1883–1971) is the woman credited for liberating the women from the constraints of the corsets. She was the daughter of an itinerant vendor, and lived in rundown lodgings. When her mom died, her dad sent her and her sister to an orphanage, where she learnt to sew. Later she started to sing at a cabaret, where she got her nickname Coco, and did many jobs where her charm was really useful. Her fashion career really took off when she started selling hats designed by herself.⁠
