Lowri Morgan was a track and field runner, part of her city's athletic club, and ran in 1500 meters events. She joined her university's rugby team and played on the Welsh national team, but due to an injury she pulled the cruciate ligaments and had to have a torn knee cartridge removed, spending a year in a wheelchair. While doctors told her she was never going to be able to run again, she stepped up to the challenge, eventually receiving national honors in both cross country and rugby. Besides being tv host and producer, and motivational speaker, Lowri is mostly an ultramarathon runner: she is one of the few athlete to have completed the 6633 Ultra in the Arctic, and the Amazon Ultra, in which she suffered from stress fractures in her feet and had to use crutches, but was the sole finisher. Both of these events were filmed and made into documentaries. She said that in every extreme event she participated she suffered from hallucinations, loneliness and crippling pain, but her passion for pushing boundaries is far stronger than any discomfort she has ever faced.⁠
