Maya Lin (1959-) is a designer, architect and artist that works with sculptures and land art. In the US she achieved national recognition when, at age 21, her project got chosen for the Vietnamese Veterans Memorial. Maya grew up in rural Ohio, and from there comes the attention to environmental issues that she puts in her work: what she tries to do is to find balance in the landscape, respecting nature rather than trying to dominate it. The Memorial she designed represents an opening or a wound in the earth, where the wall with the names of the fallen could be seen as the scar covering it: the design was picked in a "blind" competition, and it sparked a lot of backslash. Some of the critiques were to the Memorial itself, being deemed of a too dark color and only honoring the fallen and not all the combatants; some critique targeted directly Maya because of her Chinese heritage. In the end, an additional statue has been added to the Memorial, whose original design didn't change, to try to appease the malcontent. Nowadays, the same memorial also serves for veterans of Afghanistan and Iraq.‚Å†
