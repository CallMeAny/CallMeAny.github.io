Rasila Vadher is the first woman forest guard in Gujarat's Gir National Park in India, the last habitat of Asiatic lions in the world. Her all-women team, named "Lion Queens of India", are in charge of rescuing injured lions, look for orphaned cubs and act against poaching. She has been involved in more then 1000 animal rescues, and it is said that "she walks in jungle more confidently than even lion king". She said that initially nobody supported the idea of a woman working in the front line, wondering how she could work with big animals. She proved that she can work as her equal, and now they acknowledge that yes, a woman can do that work too.‚Å†
