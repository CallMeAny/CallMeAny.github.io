Maria Montessori (1870-1952) was an Italian physician and educator. She hoped to become an engineer and enrolled in all-boys technical schools, but later she changed and graduated medical school. She developed an educational method where the children are incentivated to learn and discover on their own initiative and natural abilities, mostly through practical play.‚Å†
