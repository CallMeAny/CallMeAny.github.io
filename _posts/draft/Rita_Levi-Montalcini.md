Rita Levi-Montalcini (1909-2012) decided to attend medical school after seeing a friend die of cancer. Her father didn't like the idea, as he thought that a too well educated girl might have difficulties to find a husband. But Rita was good, and even her dad in the end supported her. But her family was Jewish, so during WWII she was banned from the university. Instead, she continued her studies about the growth of nerve fibers in a laboratory she made in her bedroom, working on chicken embryos. After the war she could replicate her results in a real laboratory, and she came to isolating nerve growth factor, for which she received a Nobel in Physiology or Medicine. Thanks to her scientific achievements, she was given the honor of Senator for Life in the Italian Senate.‚Å†
