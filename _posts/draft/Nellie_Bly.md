Nellie Bly (1864-1922) was actually called Elizabeth Cochran Seaman. She picked her pen name working as journalist: after reading an article stating that women are good only as child birther and house keepers, she wrote a response that was so good the newspaper director reached out to her and offered her to write a piece. She wrote about divorce issues, and the director was so impressed that he offered her a full time job. She was the first investigative journalist ever: her articles about women factory workers stirred so many complains from the factory owners that she had to move to writing about fashion and gardening for a while. She moved to Mexico and wrote about local culture, and one piece about the dictatorship made the authorities threaten her with arrest. Back in America she worked on an undercover assignment, to check reports of brutality in an asylum. She faked insanity, and after ten days at the asylum she wrote a piece that sparked reforms and gave her long-lasting fame. As a challenge to Jules Verne's novel, she complete a tour of the world in 72 days, most of it in steamships and railroads, and carrying only her dress, a coat, underwear and essential toiletries.‚Å†
