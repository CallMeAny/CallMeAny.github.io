Alva Myrdal (1902-1986) studied psychology, education and sociology and was one of the driving forces for the creation of the welfare state in Sweden, in particular how to pair individual liberty and child-bearing. After WWII she was part of the effort for disarmament, and thanks to her activism she received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1982.‚Å†
