Tu Youyou (1930-) is a Chinese pharmaceutical chemist and malariologist. She discovered artemisinin, allowing a breakthrough in the cure for malaria and advancing tropical medicine. Thanks to her work, millions of lifes have been saved from the disease. She was awarded the Lasker Award in clinical medicine and the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine together with two other colleagues. Youyou is the first Chinese to receive a Nobel in that field, and the first female citizen of China to receive a Nobel prize in any category.‚Å†
