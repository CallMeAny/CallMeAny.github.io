Alakhai Beki (~1191-1230) was a daughter of Genghis Kahn, who was married off to a relative of the king of a southern tribe. The plan of Genghis Kahn was that in doing so she would provide him with a way out of the Gobi desert, while supplying him with horses and provisions in his conquest wars. However, the plan didn't work: the tribe revolted against Alakhai and tried to kill her, forcing her to run away with her stepsons while the rest of her family and supporters were killed. Alakhai rejoined his dad in the Mongol army, and upon hearing of what had happened, Genghis Kahn sent forces to suffocate the revolt and to exterminate all male members of the tribe as retaliation. It is Alakhai that persuaded him not to do this, and instead just punish the murderers of her family: thanks to her act, this is the only tribe conquered by Genghis Kahn that rebelled and managed to survive. After the revolt, the tribe became loyal to Alakhai, and she was also left in charge of all the conquered Chinese territories, which she governed with the help of all-women political counselors.‚Å†
