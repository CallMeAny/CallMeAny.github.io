Qiu Jin (1875-1907) was stuck in an unhappy marriage, and decided to leave China and her two sons to go study in Japan. She was fond of martial arts and of wearing western male dresses, and her nationalist ideas made her join revolutionary groups. She went back to China to become active in the movements and started working for revolutionary propaganda. She spoke out for women's rights such as the freedom to marry, freedom of education and abolishment of the practice of foot binding. She became the head of what was officially a sport's school but actually a training facility for revolutionaries. When authorities captured her, even under torture she refused to admit her involvement in a planned uprising, so she was instead incriminated for her writings and beheaded.‚Å†
