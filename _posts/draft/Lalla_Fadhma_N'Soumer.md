Lalla Fadhma N'Soumer (~1830-~1863) was part of the Algerian resistance during the first years of the French colonial invasion of Algeria. Lalla Fadhma always had a strong character, proved for example by her insistence in following the lessons in her dad's Koranic school, which was highly unusual for girls. She was married very young, but refuses the role of wife and mother and went back to her religious studies, leading an ascetic life. Soon pilgrims started visiting her, believing she could communicate with saints and foresee the future. When the French were besieging her city, Lalla Fadhma started convincing the men to take a stand and go to war. She take part to the battles too, providing food to the fighters and tending at the injured. For a few years the actual command of the resistance was of Bou Baghla, said to be a lieutenant of the defeated Emir, but upon his death the armed forces moved under the command of Lalla Fadhma, assisted by her brothers. After a desperate resistance against the much bigger and stronger French army, Lalla Fadhma was taken prisoner and held in a camp, in which she died of infection years later. Lalla is an honorific title, reserved for women of high rank or who are venerated as saints: from a European point of view, she was the Joanne d'Arc of Algeria.‚Å†
