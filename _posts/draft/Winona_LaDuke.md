Winona LaDuke (1959-) is known for her work on tribal land claims, and on sustainable development. She is part of the Ojibwe Nation, and started working as principal of the high school at the White Earth reservation after her college graduation. When she moved into the reservation and got to know the people and the language there, she became an activist: she worked to publicize the forced sterilization of Native American women, and she became involved in the struggle to revoke the lands for the Anishinaabe. With the proceeds of a human rights award she received, Winona founded a project with the goal to buy back the land sold to non-Natives, and to create enterprises to improve the local economy. They are working on reforesting the land, and revive cultivation of wild rice and other traditional products. Additionally, and more controversially, she started an industrial hemp farm, advocating it as a moneymaking opportunity for the tribal communities. In 2016, Winona was involved in the Dakota Access Pipeline protests, participating in the resistance camps and speaking to the media.‚Å†
