Marie Curie (1867-1934) was born in Warsaw, and she studied at the clandestine Flying University. She was a pioneer on the studies about radioactivity (a word she invented), she invented techniques for isolating radioactive isotopes, and she discovered two elements, polonium and radium. Thanks to her research, she was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the first person and only woman to win it twice, first in physics and then in chemistry, and the only person to win it in two different scientific fields. Her work sadly also caused her death: due to the long exposure to radiations, her body stopped producing enough blood cells. This happened because, given that she was a pioneer, she had no idea how dangerous her working material was.‚Å†
