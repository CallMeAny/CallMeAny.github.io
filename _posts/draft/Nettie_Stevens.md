Nettie Stevens (1861-1912) is the geneticist that discovered sex chromosomes. Nettie could get a good education thanks to her father, whose carpentering job earned him enough to send her and her sister to high school. Nettie always excelled, and continued her studies obtaining an MA in biology. She became interested in histology, which is the study of the microscopic anatomy of biological tissues, and went on to get a Phd in cytology. Shortly after the rediscovery of Mendel's genetics theory, she observed that male mealworms produced two kinds of sperm. When an egg was fertilized with the sperm with large chromosome, it produced female offspring; egg fertilized with small chromosome sperm produced male offspring. This allowed to discover the cause of sex-discrimination during reproduction.‚Å†
