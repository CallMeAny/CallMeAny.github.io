Clare Smyth (1978-) is a Northern Irish chef. She decided to pursue that career when, at 15, she worked at a local restaurant during her holidays. She moved on to study catering, and in 2002 Gordon Ramsay offered her a post in his restaurant. In 2007 she became head chef there, and became the first female chef in the UK to run a restaurant with three Michelin stars. In 2017 she opened her own restaurant, which was awarded two stars in the 2019 Michelin guide. In 2018, Clare was named the World's best female chef.⁠
