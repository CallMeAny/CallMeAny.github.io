Lindsey Vonn (1984-) first started skiing when she was 2 years old. Her grandfather taught her. She entered a ski club where she was exposed to all kinds of terrain and gained her all-mountain skills. Her entire family moved to Colorado to allow her to improve, and for her speed was everything: the faster she went, the bigger the smile she got on her face. She always found the fall line, the quickest way to go down a mountain, and followed it perfectly. Until her first Olympic Games she rode her talent, but afterwards, realizing how weak she was in sports different than skiing, she decided that she needed to actually put some real effort and determination in training. During her career she won many competitions, and in 2016 she won her 20th World Cup Crystal Globe title, the overall record among both men and woman.‚Å†
