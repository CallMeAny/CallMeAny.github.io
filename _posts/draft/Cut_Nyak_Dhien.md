Cut Nyak Dhien (1848-1908) was a leader of the Acehnese guerrilla during the Aceh War in Indonesia. She came from an aristocratic family, and was educated in religion and household matters: many men asked for her hand, until her parents arranged her marriage for her. When the Dutch declared war on Aceh, they gut pushed back once but on their second attempt they managed to capture the Sultan's palace. Cut was evacuated, while her husband stayed back fighting and died in action. Later a Acehnese hero proposed to her, but she rejected him until he allowed her to fight. With the was ongoing, the Acehnese were under-supplied and Cut's husband surrendered to the Dutch forces: he was appointed commander, and from the start had planned to betray them and rejoin his wife with troops, equipment and ammunition. When he was killed in combat, Cut kept on the fight: it took a traitor revealing the location of her headquarters to the Dutch for Cut to get captured, but her daughter escaped and continued the resistance. ‚Å†
