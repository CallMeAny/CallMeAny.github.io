Emily Greene Balch (1867-1961) was a feminist and pacifist: she was always interested in socioeconomical issues, and when teaching in Wellesley College she focused on immigration, consumption and the economic roles of women. She was a leader of the Women's Trade Union League, and served in the first commission on minimum wages for women. When the US entered WWI, she opposed conscription in espionage legislation, and supported the civil liberties of conscientious objectors. She was religious, and her thought was that American economy was "far from being in harmony with the principles of Jesus which we profess." She became a leader of the international peace movement, and played a central role in what became the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. In 1946 she won the Nobel Peace Prize for her work with the League.‚Å†
