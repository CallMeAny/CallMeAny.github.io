Junko Tabei (1939-2016) was the first woman to reach the summit of Mount Everest, and to ascend all the Seven Summits. As a kid she was considered frail, but after a class trip she realized she enjoyed the panoramas one could view from top of mountains, and the non-competitive nature of the sport. However, her family could not support the cost of her hobby, so she did only a few climbs over her school years. After graduating, she joined a few men's climbing clubs, and while in some she was welcomed, in others her motivations were questioned (some men said she climbed with them only to find a husband). So in 1967 she established the Joshi-Tohan Club (Women's Mountaineering Club), with the slogan "Let's go on an overseas expedition by ourselves": they successfully reached the summit of Annapurna III, using a new south-side route and achieving the first female and first Japanese ascent. After that they aimed for Mount Everest: the economical side of the expedition was so heavy that the ladies purchased goose feather from China to make their own sleeping bags, and recycled car seats to make waterproof pouches and overgloves. After the successful ascent on Everest, she went on with her all-female mountaineering expeditions around the world, making a point of never accepting corporate sponsorship and staying financially independent: expeditions were founded with public speaking, guided tours, and tutoring of local children in music and English. Junko also wrote seven books, and took care to organize expeditions to clean up rubbish left behind by climbers on Everest, and leading annual climbs to Mount Fuji for the youth affected by the Great East Japan Earthquake.‚Å†
