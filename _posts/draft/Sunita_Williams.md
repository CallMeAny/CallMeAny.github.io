Sunita Williams (1965-) started a military career, and then moved to training as an astronaut in 1998. She went to the ISS (International Space Station) for Expedition 14 and 15, and while on board she had her hair cut so that she could donate her pony tail to Locks of Love. During the same expedition, she enlisted for the Boston marathon, which she run from space on the ISS treadmill, completing the race in 4 hours and 24 minutes. She went back to the ISS for Expedition 32 and 33, where she completed a triathlon, corresponding to the Nautica Malibu Triathlon: she "swam" 0.5 miles on the ARED, biked 18 miles on the stationary bike and run 4 miles on the treadmill, finishing with a time of 1 hour, 48 minutes and 33 seconds.‚Å†
