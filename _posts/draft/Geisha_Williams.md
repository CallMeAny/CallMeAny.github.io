Geisha Williams (1961-) was born in Cuba, and migrated to the US after her father, a political prisoner, was released. Geisha's dad worked multiple jobs to support the family, while she worked hard to gain her Bachelor's degree in industrial engineering and later an MBA. She started working as a residential energy auditor, and joined PG&E in 2007. It took her 10 years to become the CEO of the company, the first Latina to hold that position in a Fortune 500 company. She left the company in 2019, after wildfires caused huge financial and legal repercussions on the company. She is criticized for the huge compensation that she still received prior to her departure and the bankruptcy of PG&E, but the CEO that followed a few months later started his job with more than twice her base salary.‚Å†
