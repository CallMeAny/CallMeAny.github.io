Marie Equi (1872-1952) was a doctor dedicated to providing care to working-class and poor patients. She was openly lesbian, and with her partner she adopted an infant, creating an early example of alternative family. With her medical practitioning, she provided birth control information and abortion at a time when both were illegal. She was advocating for civic and economic reforms, among which women's right to vote and an eight-hour workday. She aligned herself with anarchists after being clubbed by a policeman during a workers' strike.‚Å†
Marie was regarded as a hero and awarded a medal thanks to her volunteer work with the victims of the San Francisco earthquake, when the government wasn't ready to provide the needed mass relief. However, due to her work, political views and same-sex relations, she faced discrimination and harassment. Her speaking against US involvement in WWI even got her sentenced three years in the San Quentin state prison. ‚Å†
In 2019, Marie's name was included in the Rainbow Honor Walk in San Francisco.‚Å†
