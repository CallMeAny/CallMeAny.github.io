Agatha Christie (1890-1976) had always been an avid reader. However, her first attempts at writing were not successful, and only the encouragement of her family kept her going. During world wars she worked first as a nurse and then as a pharmacy assistant, gaining the knowledge in poisons that she used in many of the novels. The characters of Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple brought her fame and are still well known nowadays. A little mystery is part of her life, when she run away after an argument with her husband: her car was found in a quarry but she was missing. They found her only ten days afterwards, registered in a hotel with a different name.‚Å†
