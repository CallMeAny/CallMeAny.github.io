Helen Sharman (1963-) is the first British astronaut and the first woman to visit the Mir space station. She applied to the Project Juno program after hearing a radio advertisement looking for the first British space explorer, and was selected among almost 13000 other applicants. She spent 18 months in intensive training in Star City in Russia, and even though the Project Juno was almost cancelled due to financial issues, her project could advance under Soviet expense. She went into space aged 27 years and 11 months, and stayed there for 8 days: she worked at medical and agricultural tests, photographed the British Isles and took part in an amateur radio hookup with British schoolchildren. She never had the opportunity to return to space, although twice she made it into the lists of ESA as a possible applicant.‚Å†
