Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (1989-) is the youngest woman ever to serve in the United States Congress. She is democrat, advocating among the rest for Medicare for all, free public college and higher taxes for the rich. She comes from the Puerto Rican community in the Bronx, and after college where she graduated in international relations and economics, she went back there working long shifts as waitress and bartender, and volunteering for the National Hispanic Institute. After working as a campaign organizer for Bernie Sanders in 2016, she visited the Standing Rock Indian Reservation, where she realized that wealth and social influence were not the only ways to run for office.‚Å†
