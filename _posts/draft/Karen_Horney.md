Karen Horney (1885-1952) was an ambitious kid: despite what people told her, she felt that she could not be pretty, so instead she decided to focus on her intellectual abilities. Against her parents wishes, she entered medical school, and became a psychoanalyst. She questioned Freudian views, developing theories on sexuality and founding feminist psychology in response to Freud's theory of penis envy. She pointed out that differences in the psychology of men and women could be traced back to society and culture, rather than to biology.‚Å†
