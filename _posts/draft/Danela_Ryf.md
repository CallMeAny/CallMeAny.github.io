Danela Ryf (1987-) is a Swiss triathlete, and she is 4 times Ironman World Champion and 5 times World Champion on the 70.3 distance. Winning both races that many times consecutively is a result never achieved before, neither by men nor women. She discovered the discipline of triathlon in 1998 and managed to go professional in 2007, but started doing long distances later: Ironman is made of a 4km swim, 180 km bike ride and a 42km marathon (the 70.3 distance is a half Ironman). To achieve her results, Daniela trains for 30 hours a week, and is constantly on the road, either looking for the best training conditions or to take part into big competitions‚Å†
