Laskarina Bouboulina (1771-1825) was a Greek naval commander and is considered the first woman-admiral of the Imperial Russian Navy. Laskarina took over the fortune of her second husband, who was a shipowner and captain, when he was killed in a battle against Algerian pirates. She made the trading business prosper, and built 4 more ships, including a large warship: she had to bribe Turkish officials to ignore the ship size, and later this became the largest vessel in the hands of the Greek rebels fighting for independence from the Ottomans.‚Å†
The Ottomans tried to confiscate her property because of her late husband services for the Russians, so she met the Russian ambassador and seekd his protection, going into exile. She then returned, and although her name does not appear in historical member lists of Greek independentist groups, she organized her own troops, and used her fortune to provide food and weapons for her sailors and soldiers. She joined forces with other islands, and began a naval blockade; then arrived in Tripolis and proceeded to save most of the female members of the sultan's household during the fall of the Ottoman garrison.‚Å†
After her death, Tsar Alexander I of Russia granted Laskarina the honorary rank of Admiral of the Russian Navy, and in 2018 she was granted the title of Rear Admiral in the Hellenic Navy.‚Å†
