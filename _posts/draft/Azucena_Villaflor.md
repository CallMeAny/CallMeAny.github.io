Azucena Villaflor (1924-1977) was an Argentinian human right activist. After the military dictatorship took over Argentina, one of Azucena's sons was abducted. She started looking for him, and that's when she met other women that were searching for missing relatives. After six months she still couldn't get any information about her son, so she set up a demonstration: on 30 April 1977 she and thirteen other mothers went to Plaza de Mayo in central Buenos Aires and started marching around the Plaza, in defy to the police that had told them to "circulate". Later the same year Azucena was taken from her home from armed forces, and she is reported to have been detained in a concentration camp. After exhumation her body was identified, and the cause of death seemed to be a "death flight", where prisoners where drugged and flung out of aircrafts.‚Å†
