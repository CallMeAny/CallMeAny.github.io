Fatima Ahmed Ibrahim (~1930-2017) was a Sudanese writer, activist and socialist leader. She began to support women's rights at secondary school, where she created a wall newspaper (written in large fonts, they were meant to be hung up a wall and read form there) called "Pioneer Girls". She run the first women's strike in Sudan because her school decided to cancel science lessons in favor of "family science" lessons, and her strike was successful. She founded multiple women's associations, among which the Sudanese Women's Unions, with which she fought for political rights, equality in salaries and education, and literacy. Her ideas caused clash with the political class, and even with the religious class, as she believed that Islam could be used as a progressive force against religious conservatives.‚Å†
