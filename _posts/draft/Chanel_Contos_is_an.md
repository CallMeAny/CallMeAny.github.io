Chanel Contos is an Australian sexual assault survivor and an activist. She created the Teach Us Consent petition with an aim was to get insight into the number of sexual assaults at private schools and demand a change in New South Wales. To her surprise, the petition was signed by more than 25,000 people whereas the sexual assault testimonies were more than 4,000. 1,500 of them have been reviewed. Her initial plan was to see the principals of private higher schools, use the testimonies to alarm them and push for earlier and compulsory consent education in schools. However, the action has gained monumentem and in March 2021, Chanel worked together with Stacey Maloney to enable sex assault survivors to report the crime without launching an investigation and launched Project Vest. The idea is to empower victims to get a closure which might be crucial in their healing without the danger of revictimization that the reporting and contact with the police might pose. There will be no consequences for the perpetrators unless they reoffend. The strength of Chanel and of all others who fight against sexual violence is an inspiration to all of us.â�
