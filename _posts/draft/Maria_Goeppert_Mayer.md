Maria Goeppert Mayer (1906-1972) wrote her doctoral thesis on how atoms can absorb photons to move to a higher energy state. At the time, there was no way to experimentally verifying her hypothesis, but nowadays with the laser that has been proved and the theory brings her name. From Germany she moved to the US and got jobs at many different Universities, and during WWII took part in the Manhattan project. She is mostly known for developing a model for the structure of nuclear shells, work for which she was awarded the Nobel Prized shared with two colleagues. Nowadays, an award with her name is given out to women that reach astounding results in physics in their early careers.‚Å†
