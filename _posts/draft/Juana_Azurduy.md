Juana Azurduy (1780-1862) was born in Upper Peru when it was still a Spanish colony. She defied many rules in of the strict society of the time by being of European and Indigenous American descent, and by learning to ride and be a skilled sharpshooter. Juana was sent to a convent to become a nun, and there she started idolizing Joan of Arc and became interested in the battlefield. After being expelled from the convent, she returned in her father's hacienda and witnessed the brutal conditions in Spanish silver mines. She joined the Chuquisaca Revolution in 1809, and fought again and again for Bolivian independence. She became a legend when she left a battlefield to give birth to her fourth son, and rejoined the fight only hours later to go on and personally capture the standard of the defeated Spanish forces. General Belgrano was so impressed with her leadership and the bravery of her soldiers that he gifted her his own sword, the symbol of his military power.‚Å†
