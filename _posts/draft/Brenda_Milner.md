Brenda Milner (1918-) is known as "the founder of neuropsychology". She was born in a family of talented musicians, but she had no interest in music: instead, her dad tutored her in mathematics, and that's what she started to study in College. However, she decided that was not the field for her, so she changed her field of study to psychology. As a graduate she took interest in the human brain and in the study of brain lesions, however after WWII her research was diverted in developing tests for selecting aircrew, in particular she was tasked to create aptitude tests to distinguish fighter pilots from bomber pilots. Brenda was a pioneer in studying human memory and cognitive functions, and it was thanks to one of her articles showing that temporal lobe damage can cause emotional and intellectual changes in the patients that many neurosurgeons stopped performing surgeries that could negatively impact the patients lives. She hypothesized that there are different types of learning and memories, each dependent on a separate system of the brain, and could prove the existence of a couple of these memories. In 2017 she was still teaching, and exploring the interaction between the brain's left and right hemispheres.‚Å†
