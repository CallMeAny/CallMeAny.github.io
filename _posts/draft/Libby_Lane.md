Libby Lane (1966-) is the Bishop of Derby in the Church of England, first woman to hold such a charge after the general synod of the Church of England voter do allow women to become bishops in 2014. She studied theology, and was ordered deacon in 1993 and priest one year later. Her appointment as bishop was called historic and an important step towards gender equality in the Church. During her consecration, when the archbishop asked the congregation if everybody agreed on her consecration, an Anglo-Catholic priest intervened saying that "it's not in the Bible" and her being a woman "an absolute impediment". Upon asking a second time after explaining the legality of the act, the archbishop wasn't interrupted again. One of her first duties as bishop was the consecration of another bishop, who opposed women taking that role. So rather than taking part in the laying of hands, she and other bishops gathered in prayer, letting only three bishops on the laying of hands ritual.‚Å†
