Maria Grazia "Lella" Lombardi (1941-1992) raced in 17 Formula One World Championship Grand Prix races, and is the only female driver in history to have a top six finish in a World Championship race and scoring points in Formula One (she received half a point, due to a shortened race distance). After some karting experience and racing in different Formula categories, she debuted in Formula One with a privately entered car but failed to qualify.The following year she was invited to compete again, and raced for the entire season. She went on driving sports cars, for example in the 24h of Le Mans and in the NASCAR circuit. After retiring, she founded her own racing team, Lombardi Autosport.‚Å†
