Luisa Capetillo (1879-1922) was homeschooled by her parents in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, in a very liberal environment regarding philosophical and political ideologies. Luisa found a job as a reader in a cigar-making company, where people were hired to read novels and current vents to workers. It is in this factory that she had her first contact to labor unions, which further developed her ideals of anarchism and romanticism that she had acquired through literature and through her mom's education. Luisa started to write propaganda and essays, which were published in radical and union newspapers, and she traveled through the country educating and organizing women; on top of that she started her own newspaper, called La Mujer, where she discussed of women's issues. While reading for women laborers, she developed her feminist opinions, and was considered Puerto Rico's first suffragist, and challenged the mainstream society by wearing pants in public. These are Luisa's words on social equality and feminism: "Oh you woman! who is capable and willing to spread the seed of justice; do not hesitate, do not fret, do not run away, go forward! And for the benefit of the future generations place the first stone for the building of social equality in a serene but firm way, with all the right that belongs to you, without looking down, since you are no longer the ancient material or intellectual slave."‚Å†
