Bayan Mahmoud Al-Zahran is the first female attorney in Saudi Arabia. She was at first focused on domestic violence, but later studied also cases of financial and criminal prisoners. Prior to the licensing of the Saudi women, female law graduates were only allowed to serve as legal consultants. Bayan founded Saudi Arabia's first all-woman law firm, with the purpose to bring Saudi women's problems before the court, and giving a female perspective on issues.‚Å†
