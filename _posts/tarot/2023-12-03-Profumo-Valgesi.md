**Title:** Il profumo dei Valgesi \
**Author:** Malik Tariq Bashir \
**Character:** Virginia Maltesi

Brand new italian book... and a really confusing one at that. The entire story is a dream, but that seems little excuse for the poor writing. So the spread is on the few well written chapters about the main character, and not within her dreams.

**Overview:** the querent is the important figure here, and the spread talks about her passions

**Interpretation:**

* The Emperess: the querent \
Virginia had this oniric experience that led her through her coma. Now that she awoke she can look back with understanding and love towards herself.

* Ace of Wands: what to leave in the past \
Despite being on a healing path, it is not the moment for new projects or passionate plans.

* Knight of Wands: what to learn from the past \
It is instead the right moment to focus on avoiding improvised things that could hinder the healing process.
