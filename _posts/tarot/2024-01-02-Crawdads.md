**Title:** Where the Crawdads sings \
**Author:** Delia Owens \
**Character:** Kya Clark \

A bit slow, a lot of descriptions, and a main character way too smart for what her situation. I guess evidence that literacy is important... Anyway, spread inspired by Maslow's pyramid of needs.

**Overview:** a spread with a sense of strength, and the female figure sitting at the center, proud but alone

**Interpretation:**

* 7 of Wands: physical needs \
Physical safety for Kya means fending for herself, making it alone despite all of her community trying to bring her down.

* Page of Swords: safety and stability \
She has been learning all of her life what safety and stability are, constantly polishing her weapons and learning all she can to survive.

* The Star: love and belonging \
Love and belonging are a constant wish, and also a constant fear: she feels the most confident  when alone in the nature that she knows so well.

* 4 of Cups: recognition and acknowledgment \
Kya has had too many things taken from her to be ready to accept what new life may offer.

* The Magician: self fulfillment \
Kya managed to transform her knowledge into a mean that can sustain her, and also to fool an entire town with her act of bravery.
