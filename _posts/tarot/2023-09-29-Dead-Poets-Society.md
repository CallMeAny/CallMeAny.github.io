**Title:** Dead Poets Society \
**Author:** N. H. Kleinbaum \
**Character:** John Keating

From what I understood, this book has been written based on the movie... Yeah, sadly the movie is better. I improvised a literary spread, I do not know any Shakespeare so I went with Dante instead.

**Overview:** out of three cards, two are reversed swords: there seems to be a lot of troubles with intellectual energy

**Interpretation:**

* 5 of Swords reversed: Hell \
There is something wrong with the school itself, trying to impose too much authority. But Mr. Keating might have also sinned by imposing his approach clearly in complete conflict with the schools approach.

* 8 of Swords reversed: Purgatory \
Mr Keating might be the victim, but most of it was his own doing: while trying to make free thinkers out of the students, he ended up creating a bunch of emulators that never considered the consequences of their actions.

* The Fool: Paradise \
While there is sadness when forced to leave, there doesn't seem to be guilt for Mr Keating. He did what he wanted, didn't fall short of his own values and cared for the students as well as he could. He is now free to start over, and despite the accusations he has no guilt and no regrets.

**Shadow card:** 4 of Coins \
I pulled a shadow card because three cards are not many to do a complete reading. And the card talks about clinging and hoarding. While it usually refers to material goods, I guess in this case it confirms that we have to do with people that are all thinking they are right in their respective approaches and positions.
