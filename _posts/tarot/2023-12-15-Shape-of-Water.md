**Title:** Shape of Water \
**Driector:** Guillermo del Toro \
**Character:** Elisa Esposito \

This was... bizarre. So pretty much what one would expect from a del Toro movie. But I tend to disagree with those saying that she is the same as the fish.

<!--more-->

**Overview:** the one major card is in the spot representing the fish, and the reverses are in the spots for the relationship... troubled water coming up, possibly.

**Interpretation:**

* 9 of Wands: the querent \
Elisa is battered, protected but also isolate by her mutism, and certainly injured and possibly afraid by the future.

* The Magician: the friend \
The creature is a god, a carrier and deliverer of energy, of a kind that humans cannot understand.

* King of Coins reversed: current status of the relationship \
The relationship evolved to something that gives Elisa the recognition she has been aching for, but hard to say the same for the being: maybe for him she is just an entertaining toy.

* Queen of Wands: shared interests and goals \
Elisa is exploring her physical passion, an outlet for sexual energy but also for her maternal instincts. This certainly aligns with the needs of the being, who is cared for no questions asked.

* Ace of Cups reversed: how to strengthen the relationship \
The energy, or maybe the hormones, is certainly flowing, but Elisa should be ware of this connection that could suddenly stop, or maybe grow to the point that she will be swept away.
