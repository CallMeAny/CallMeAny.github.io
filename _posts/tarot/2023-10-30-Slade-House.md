**Title:** Slade House \
**Author:** David Mitchell \
**Character:** Lady Norah Grayer

Really enjoyed the story, hard to find a character for a tarot reading! Picked a spread with a theme that seemed to fit the generational arc.

**Overview:** quite some reversed cards, and no major arcana... for somebody with such a long lifespan, could mean it's hard to get life-defining moments maybe.

**Interpretation:**

* 2 of Wands: inherited trauma \
Based on the card meaning, she was definitely born with the aching to see and explore behind all borders, physical and metaphysical. The number also suggests that her duality is a liability, a weight at least as much as a blessing

* 2 of Swords reversed: how to heal the trauma \
As much as she wants to take action and revenge, the forced rest will do her good. She will have to take the time to reflect on her doings, and to contemplate mortality, which is a thing she always avoided

* 3 of Coins reversed: inherited talent \
The number clearly suggests that her connection and understanding are gifts. The reverse suggests also that this brings with it a need of being appreciated and understood.

* Knight of Wands: how to use the talent \
The knight of wands is a card ready for action, but here it is reversed: it suggests that the time for action will come, but it is better to spend some time figuring it out and planning it, also suggested by the 2 of wands related to the inherited trauma.

* Knight of Coins: message from the ancestors \
The message seems to be that Lady Grayer has enough to be fulfilled, it might be the time for her to settle and enjoy it, as much as it is in her right to be ready to defend it.

**Shadow card:** The Star \
Quite the vague spread... seems appropriate that the shadow card suggests a general connection to the universe and the possibility for long term plans.
