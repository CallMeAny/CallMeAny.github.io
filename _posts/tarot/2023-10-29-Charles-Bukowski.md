**Title:** Erections, Ejaculations, Exhibitions and General Tales of Ordinary Madness \
**Author:** Charles Bukowski \
**Character:** - \

This time I went for a so-called classic, and as with other classics from the same period, it was not a reading that I enjoyed at all. The tarot reading was also challenging, as the author and the main character are often the same person in twisted ways.

**Overview:** overall, a balanced spread. The devil shows up in the "heaven" position, which seems unusual.

**Interpretation:**

* 4 of Cups: Hell \
The place of punishment for mr Bukowski is one where structure and stability are provided. His writing is based on grumbling about his misery, ignoring whatever opportunity is given to lift himself up.

* 8 of Coins: Purgatory \
Mr Bukowski is content just showing off his work, caring about is art that at the end is what provides a living to him. He shows himself through his writing and that's all he wants people to see of him, no matter whether the writing corresponds to his reality or not.

* The Devil: Paradise \
The post position for mr Bukowski is the devil, a position in which he can feed on unhealthy desires, disfunctional relationships and spiraling habits. For the most part he isn't victim of these emotions, he is the one sitting above them and observing.

**Shadow card:** The Justice \
Such a confusing book, might as well get a shadow card and try to put some sense behind it... maybe behind his writing, Mr Bukowski wants to show a society that is in need of righting, he shows the worse in the hope that instead of being emulated people will realize how miserable they are and lift themselves up.
