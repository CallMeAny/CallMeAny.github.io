**Title:** The Bluest Eye \
**Author:** Toni Morrison \
**Character:** Pecola Breedlove \

I am happy at the end of the book the author says she isn't sure that the book works as intended, because I agree with her: it felt like a salad of characters that nobody cared to toss and mix in a cohesive story.

**Overview:** a center card of joy, but difficult cards for traumas and gifts!

**Interpretation:**

* The Chariot reversed: inherited trauma \
An impossibility to exercise power, to discover and then asserting one's true self

* 5 of Swords: how to heal the trauma \
The systems is the enemy, fighting the system is the solution. It's a hard and costly battle.

* Knight of Cups reversed: inherited talent \
A willingness to help and an ability to survive transitions. But this might come at a cost

* 4 of Swords: how to use the talent \
Being patient and taking the time, the wait might be pitiful but there will be fruits

* The Sun: message from the ancestors \
Pecola deserves joy, and joy there will be despite or maybe thanks to the madness.

**Shadow card:** The Hierophant \
An appropriate card... this is all a struggle against the system and the indoctrination that comes from it. Like the idea that a little black girl is ugly, and needs blue eyes to be seen as beautiful.
