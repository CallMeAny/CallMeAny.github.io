**Title:** Alkymia (Septimus Heap III) \
**Author:** Angie Sage \
**Character:** Jenna Heap

The last book of the trilogy, and the characters are now well on their way of growing up. Jenna still doesn't like her position, but it might be time she starts to accept it and work on it. So this will be a spread about distribution of power.

<!--more-->

**Overview:** many reverses show challenges will come up, and the main focus is on material, tangible work.

**Interpretation:**

* 3 of Coins reversed: area of life to focus on \
Jenna should focus on starting to build her reign, in particular by collecting around her a supporting and trusted court. It will be a lot of work, but she shouldn't be afraid of it.

* Wheel of Fortune reversed: how power is being given away \
At least until now, the power has certainly not been in her hands: everything has been spinning and changing constantly, but luckily it seems that the worse is behind her.

* King of Cups reversed: how power can be reclaimed \
Reclaiming her power would require stepping up as the queen, officially taking the spot that is hers from birth. Jenna is conflicted about this position, but she has an emotional intelligence that will help her being a graceful queen.

* 10 of Cups: what to be mindful of moving forward \
Of course, moving forward Jenna should never forget where she comes from: her roots and her family will be a reminder of what is right, but also a great support in her needs.

**Shadow card:** 6 of Cups \
This seems to explain why Jenna is so troubled in taking her rightful position: all she wants (and don't we all...) is to be free from concerns, in her innocent joy.
