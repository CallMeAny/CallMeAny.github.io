**Title:** The Dividing \
**Author:** Devin Downing \
**Character:** Roselyn Malik; Matt MacArthur

This time a YA fantasy, and I decided both main characters deserved a reading... independently from each other, because romantic interests would be too easy. I used the Rose spread, as mentioned in the Rootlock Radio podcast.

__**Roselyn**__

**Overview:** balanced draw, no reverse card so energy is flowing properly. Two coin cards indicate that material forces are into play.

**Interpretation:**
* 3 of Swords: The root (foundations) \
Rose is torn by heartbreak, both for his friends and family, and for Cavernum that she discovers not being as perfect as she thought.

* King of Coins: The thorn (discomfort) \
She knows she will become queen, and all of those problems will become her responsibility.

* Wheel of Fortune: The stem (support) \
Things are definitely changing in Cavernum, but it is not clear yet in favor of what faction.

* 8 of Cups: The bud (nurturing) \
Rose needs to figure out who is her friend and who is her enemy, navigating secrets and lies.

* 3 of Coins: The blossom (outcome) \
If she manages, she will be surrounded by a supporting court and her queendom will be admired for her reforms and ideas. 

__**Matt**__

**Overview:** a lot of majors in this draw, about things with lifelong impact. Things are rooted in emotions, but a reverse sword talks about mental blocks.

* Knight of Cups: The root (foundations) \
Matt is ready to walk on his legs and take on whatever faces him, but his actions are tamed by his readiness to help.

* Ace of Swords reversed: The thorn (discomfort) \
The logic that he applies to his choices sometimes get on his way, putting him on the harder path.

* The World: The stem (support) \
The love for his mom is the only thing pushing him forward.

* The Magician: The bud (nurturing) \
Focusing on acquiring the healing powers that he seeks is the best choice: quite literally becoming the magician.

* The Fools: The blossom (outcome) \
If he manages, he will be free of all responsibilities, free to take on whatever path he actually desires rather than the ones he was forced to choose.
