**Title:** A Vintage Affair \
**Author:** Isabel Wolff \
**Character:** Phoebe Swift

Now I know why I usually don't read cheap romance books... all the characters seem so self centered! No need to pull a card, the lesson for myself is: there is not only one truth to things.

<!--more-->

**Overview:** a spread focusing on the past, and fittingly enough also focusing on the material side of things.

**Interpretation:**

* 2 of Cups reversed: the querent \
Phoebe lives in a broken duality, what happened to her friend left her feeling like she lost half of herself. All of her relationships seem to be split: her mom and dad parted ways, her love interests are not ideal. There is a willingness, or even a need to connect but Phoebe feels stuck.

* 10 of Coins: what to leave in the past \
There is no going back to a lost stability and security. Seeking to rebuild it the same way will not work. The sense of accomplishment is gone and a sense of loss took over. This should be lived but also accepted in order to metabolize it and move on.

* 7 of Coins: what to learn from the past \
Good things come if we work for them, and there is solace in working hard and seeing the results. Phoebe already took a big step in this direction opening her shop, she should now do the same with her relationships. Weed out the bad herbs, and focus on the things that you want to grow

**Shadow card:** 9 of Swords \
While my own impression is of a self-centered character, the shadow card reminds that Phoebe is living through so much regret and guilt.
