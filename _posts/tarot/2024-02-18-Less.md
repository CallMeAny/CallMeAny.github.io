**Title:** Less \
**Author:** Andrew Sean Greer \
**Character:** Arthur Less

If you ever wanted a gay, middleaged and most importantly miserable version of "Eat, Pray, Love" this is it. Note to self: stop buying books that in the back say "laugh-out-loud funny" or "this is the comedy we all need". They never are funny nor comedy.

**Overview:** in a spread using Jung's psyche model, it seems appropriate that all cards are reversed: there is no big event to talk about, just a lot of messed up energy in many little things.

**Interpretation:**

* 7 of Wands reversed: persona, how we present ourselves to others\
Arthur projects the personality of somebody constantly fighting to keep some upper hand, but while he thinks he is better than everybody else, he is mostly seen as going against windmills.

* Page of Cups reversed: shadow, what we are most ashamed of in ourselves \
He is full of emotions, but has no idea how to handle them: as they say, he has no skin. An emotional child in the body of a middleage man.

* 8 of Swords reversed: anima, what are our feminine needs \
Arthur needs somebody to solve his problems, problems that more often than not are in large part existing just in his head.

* Knight of Cups reversed: animus, what are our masculine needs \
At the same time, he longs to be an example of stability, a model on which others can lay on and find wisdom and support.

* Four of Coins reversed: self, what does the heart really want \
In the end, Arthur just wants stability, but seems to confuse it with the absence of growth and evolution, making him afraid of things evolving.

**Shadow card:** 2 of Wands \
I disliked this book, so I pulled a shadow card to see what was actually going on. It seems the general problem is that from start to end, Arthur Less is doing everything he can to be in control, while the premise of a trip like his is that to be enjoyable, one has to be open to the unforeseen.
