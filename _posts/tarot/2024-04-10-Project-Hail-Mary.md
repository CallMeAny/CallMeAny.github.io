**Title:** Project Hail Mary \
**Author:** Andy Weir \
**Character:** Professor Grace

After having loved The Martian, I had high expectations of this... and it did not let down. The topic was a bit anxiety-inducing, and the whole story a long shot in suspension of belief, but all in all quite fun! So, here is a full moon spread for professor Grace when his role becomes apparent in the middle of the story.

**Overview:** feels like this spread has a lot of reverses, which aligns with the difficult situation in which Grace is.

**Interpretation:**

* Ace of Cups reversed: new moon, time to rest and let go \
For the challenge in front of him, Grace has to throw his emotions out of the window, but this of course implies the danger of getting emotionally drained.

* King of Swords reversed: waxing crescent, time to explore potential \
He has to make plans, use his knowledge to take a stand and hold his position despite the critiques.

* 3 of Cups reversed: first quarter, time to set intentions \
He will find companions in the ordeal, and time to cherish them and enjoy them.

* King of Coins: waxing gibbous, time to nurture and support \
He will grow more and more sure of his position, and he won't lack support.

* 7 of Wands: full moon, time to share and follow instincts \
It won't be a path without opposition, and he might have to fight and defend his ideas.

* 6 of Cups reversed: waning gibbous, time to keep going \
The further the project goes, the more moral dilemmas there will be: hard to take a decision for the future of the entire planet.

* The Tower reversed: last quarter, time to celebrate results \
Success won't be just positives: sacrifices will have to be made, if anything will be left at all Grace knows it will be barely standing.

* 5 of Coins: waning crescent, time to assess resource \
Leaving behind the apparently secure gardens of planet Earth will be a painful decision, but the future generations will be grateful.

**Shadow card:** Queen of Swords \
Upon the big revelation of how Grace got his position, I interpret this card as the willingness to follow the logical path despite the price.
