**Title:** Vampire Academy \
**Author:** Richelle Mead \
**Character:** Vasilisa Dragomir

A nice light story, after a handful of heavy unsatisfying reads. I wouldn't have been against some more mature content... but I guess this is the "young" part of an YA book, although being tame is not always the case in the genre. An elements-based spread, with spirit at the center.

**Overview:** a spread talking about strong emotions and flowing energy, with the only hiccup possibly being in the logic of things.

**Interpretation:**

* 7 of Cups: fire, actions to move forward \
Lissa has finally discovered and accepted who she is and what she can do. She now has the not easy task of deciding what to do with her gift.

* 10 of Cups: water, emotions affecting the situation \
Now that she doesn't have to hide anymore and has the help she needs, she finally can let herself feel part of the community without acting on some expectations she created for herself.

* Ace of wands: earth, what provides stability \
Stability comes from a source of passion and impulses: that's Rose, her guardian with which she shares an emotional bond.

* Page of Coins reversed: air, perspective on current journey \
Lissa has now a sort of material stability, not having to run anymore and knowing what is going on with her. However, she needs to keep working to ensure the stability is long lasting, both physically and mentally.

* Knight of Swords: spirit, what ties everything together \
Lissa is acting based on the possibility that she will become a leader one day, learning control over her powers will allow her to reign over her peers.
