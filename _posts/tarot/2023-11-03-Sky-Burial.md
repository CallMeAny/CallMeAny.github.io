**Title:** Sky Burial \
**Author:** Xinran \
**Character:** Zhouma

The book came highly suggested by a friend, and maybe that made my expectations too high... but even considering the cultural clash, seems that either the writer or the main character are quite naive in this story.

**Overview:** odd draw... maybe the deck was not well mixed? Only majors and cups is not that common.

**Interpretation:**

* The Hanged Man: Comfort \
Zhouma learned where to find comfort since she got lost in the grasslands: accepting things and letting them flow around her.

* Two of Cups reversed: Calm \
Her longing to find Tienanmen is satisfied so she can relax... but also has to keep in mind he will be leaving to get back to his monastery.

* Ace of Cups reversed: Safety \
Zhouma is in a whirlwind of emotions, finding and losing Tienanmen, moving to a new place and culture and way of life: it is overwhelming, but also ok to feel what she is feeling.

* The World reversed: Balm \
It might not be the perfect happy ending, but at least there is consolation in closure, and in trusting that things are as they should be.

**Shadow card:** The Magician \
For Zhouma it was a life of transformation, of multiple selves and changing energies.
