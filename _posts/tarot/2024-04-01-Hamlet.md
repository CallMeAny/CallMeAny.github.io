**Title:** Hamlet \
**Author:** William Shakespeare \
**Character:** Hamlet

Given the ending of the story, this is not a "how could this go on" reading. This is more of a "how it could have been" reading.

<!--more-->

**Overview:** a balanced spread, but surprisingly enough there are no logic and passion suits, only materialism and emotions.

**Interpretation:**

* 8 of Cups: fire, actions to move forward \
The fire position seems to suggest that Hamlet should avoid swift action, preferring instead to sit down, get control over his emotions and reflect a moment.

* 10 of Cups reversed: water, emotions affecting the situation \
The water position suggests that emotions about a powerful figure are leading Hamlet mind: he is too enraged by his mother's actions to be able to think clearly.

* 9 of Coins: earth, what provides stability \
The earth position suggests that to find stability Hamlet should look for isolation, which may help to think clearly. Going abroad as suggested by the king could be a good option (without getting killed, of course)

* The World reversed: air, perspective on current journey \
The air position shows that Hamlet might have the wrong perspective on the situation: he thinks that things are settled and definitive, and the only way to change them is drastic action.

* Six of Cups: spirit, what ties everything together \
The spirit card shows how behind the situation is the court structure, with too much people scheming and trying to achieve their own goals.

**Shadow card:** King of Coins \
The card of obtaining wealth and power, duh... I don't know what else I expected.
