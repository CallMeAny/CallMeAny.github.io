**Title:** I know why the caged bird sings \
**Author:** Maya Angelou \
**Character:** Maya

It's such a plain story, understating everything that happens... Seems appropriate using a spread based on psychology, trying to see if there is something of the main character that I missed.

**Overview:** using Jung's psyche model, we get a spread with a lot of reverse cards, but interestingly also some logic involved and a strong major in the feminine position.

**Interpretation:**

* 3 of Swords reversed: persona, how we present ourselves to others\
Maya shows a reserved personality, shy and easily hurt emotionally: her ability to see things and reflect on them alone instead of sharing lets people think she is closed and lonely.

* 4 of Coins: shadow, what we are most ashamed of in ourselves \
Maya ia aware that on her society, she is among the lucky ones: a wealthy and respected grandma, successful parents that moved to big cities. She fears that sets her aside from her peers.

* The Devil reversed: anima, what are our feminine needs \
Her feminine needs are the needs of a girl becoming a woman: sexual awakening and the traps of teh adult world. Her mind is so tangled in that, that her usual judgment is obfuscated.

* Page of Swords reversed: animus, what are our masculine needs \
Her masculine needs are those of a kids mind becoming a grown up mind: she wants to learn, and to use that knowledge to cut out a spot in the world that brings her dignity and respect.

* 9 of Cups reversed: self, what does the heart really want \
It seems that what Maya wants is gaining an understanding of others, at an emotional level. With that knowledge, she will be able to care and provide for them.

**Shadow card:** 6 of Cups \
I found the book surprisingly plain, with the most interesting episodes being relegated to a couple of paragraphs. This shadow card is a reminder of what the book is: a simple collection of memories, the joys and experiences that Maya had growing up. No need to look further to enjoy it.
