**Title:** Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki \
**Author:** Haruki Murakami \
**Character:** Tsukuru Tazaki \ 

My first Murakami book... it was a smooth read, but there was an overall sadness that made things almost sticky. Let alone when you finally get to know what has happened.

**Overview:** this spread has a ridiculous amount of reverse cards: either I can't mix properly, or Tsukuru has bigger emotional roadblocks than he ever thought. 

* The Hanged Man reverse: past influences \
Tsukuru has been through an unexpected and violent breakup from his group of friends and could never accept it and let things be. 

* 7 of Swords reversed: present influences \
He still doesn't know what to do of his independence, he feels like he did something wrong for which he deserves the punishment and the being constantly an outcast. 

* 5 of Swords reversed: hidden influences \
It's a constant issue with communication that left him alone, standing after each battle but never a winner. 

* 5 of Wands reversed: the querent \
Tsukuru is now an empty man, with no passions and no friends, almost ready to fight whoever he meets in an attempt to defend himself. 

* 4 of Coins reversed: attitude of others \
He feels that others have all the right to be attached to their own belongings and relations, and have no reason to turn to him

* Knight of Swords reversed: actions and obstacles \
Tsukuru should start thinking about himself and his own wishes instead of dwelling in the past, and should be up for jumping on new opportunities 

* 2 of Coins: outcome \
Not to think everything will be nice and easy: his path will still be rough, juggling fragile relationships and emotions. But things will get going, and he will be able to get through the mess, as he did until now.
