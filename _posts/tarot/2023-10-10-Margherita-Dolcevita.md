**Title:** Margherita Dolcevita \
**Author:** Stefano Benni \
**Character:** Margherita Dolcevita \

Quick read of an Italian author that I love... and he delivered, but damn that ending hurt! I picked a spread focusing on comfort: gotta say, I don't feel it's enough for the situation the character is in, but I wanted to try a 4 cards spread and that was the most fitting.

<!--more-->

**Overview:** most of the cards are reversed, indicating energy being wrong big time... or confirming the spread isn't ideal for the situation. Also, we can see we deal with emotions and passions, and with parental figures. This seems to be a draw that could be interpreted quite literally.

**Interpretation:**

* 5 of Swords reversed: Comfort \
Margherita has just lived through an extremely traumatic event, and there is not much consolation there other than knowing that it's now over. All the energy has been released, and she can now think about a situation in the past.

* The Emperor: Calm \
Having been a character that observed the story mostly from outside and above, Margherita's grandfather could be the person she can turn to for finding some stability and calm. He might be able to be objective and provide some relatively detached support. 

* The Emperess reversed: Safety \
Margherita's mom should be there for her to provide a safe harbor to return to, to provide the practical things in life that keep you going when all the rest has crumbled. A warm meal, a listening ear. However, the mother will be as devastated as Margherita, and probably even more confused: she might not be able to provide all these things, and she won't have the answers to what happened.

* Two of Cups reversed: Balm \
Despite both women being devastated, it is clear that their path towards better times will be shared. They will have to work step by step to reconnect with each other, to share their pain, to find strength in the other. It won't come easily, but it will lead to better times.

**Shadow card:** The Lovers \
The spread was quite clear, almost too literal and almost too easy categorizing events that cannot be categorized. I pulled a shadow card, just to see where that would have pointed. And again, it felt literal: the entire situation, the entire catastrophic development of events was started by the need of being recognized, of being part of something, of feeling strong and safe with others.
