**Title:** Matrix \
**Author:** Lauren Groff \
**Character:** Sister Marie

I did the reading after finishing the book, but I placed it temporally in the middle of the book, when Marie becomes abbess. A turning point in the story, a step up in her power and ambitions.

**Overview:** two major arcana cards make this a special reading for quite the special character.

**Interpretation:**

* Queen of Wands reversed: area of life to focus on \
Sister Marie has become the abbess and therefore the mother to her nuns. She is in a position of power that can nurture and  promote growth, but also she should try to measure that power and not get lost in her dreams of grandiosity.

* Justice reversed: how power is being given away \
Of course Sister Marie cannot direct the convent all by herself and needs to appoint people in places of responsibility: she needs to make sure it's the right people at the right place, people she can trust.

* The Devil: how power can be reclaimed \
Reclaiming power has to happen as it does in all places of politics: by recognizing the weaknesses of people and being able to use them at the right moment in the right way.

* 3 of Cups: what to be mindful of moving forward \
Sister Marie will be able to follow her schemes only if she has the support of her nuns: she needs a happy community that will have her back when times get hard.
