This reading is a little bit cheating, after all Ernesto is a person that existed and went down to history so easy to know how to interpret the cards. I went with an horseshoe spread for influences, attitudes and outcomes.

<!--more-->

**Overview:** the spread seems quite balanced, although cups are completely absent: it seems we won't be talking about relations nor about emotions.

**Interpretation:**
* 2 of Wands reversed: past influences

The current situation spawned from an ill-advised plan, the motorbike tour of the continent should have been prepared better.

* 2 of Swords: present influences
* Death: hidden influences

At the end of the trip the rising of political opinions is starting to overshadow all other aspects of Ernesto's experience, and all throughout it there is a constant undertone of something big brewing, of lower social classes being fed up with their situation. 

* Knight of Swords reversed: the querent

Ernesto is ready for action, but although he thinks he has a clear idea of what he wants he is probably over-energetic in his approach. 

* 3 of Wands: other's attitude
* 9 of Coins: actions or obstacles

People won't be hostile to him, but also not overly supportive: mostly they will stay on the side observing, too comfortable in their status and not willing to lose it.

* 3 of Coins: outcome

The success is reachable or at least possible, but the lack of resources and of spirit could prevent Ernesto from reaching it.
