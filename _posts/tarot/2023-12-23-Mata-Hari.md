**Title:** The Spy \
**Author:** Paulo Coelho \
**Character:** Mata Hari \

An iconic figure that suffered an infamating death... nobody will ever know the actual truth, but this reconstruction is quite compelling. And chances are, more than her political knowledge was her bedroom knowledge to condemn her.

**Overview:** a balanced spread, with a major arcana on the most basics of needs... could be the motivation behind the entire story.

**Interpretation:**

* The Justice reversed: physical needs \
Especially given the grim ending of her story, Mata Hari needs justice above everything else. But it can't be forgotten that the reverse justice could also be payback for the life of lies and tricks that she lead.

* Knight of Cups: safety and stability \
Mata Hari has been striving for safety and stability in the form of independence and power, luring to her as many knights as she could.

* Ace of Coins: love and belonging \
Mata's sense of love is purely materialistic and disilluded, she gives out her favors in exchange of financial and social support.

* 6 of Swords reversed: recognition and acknowledgment \
Getting recognized is a constant struggle, moving against the world politics and the advancing age.

* 5 of Cups reversed: self fulfillment \
Instead of settling, Mata focused on her fading career, which is what led her to the game of spies that ended up taking her life.
