**Title:** The Recipe Club \
**Author:**  Andrea Israel, Nancy Garfinkel \
**Character:** Valerie

Finally on holiday, a lot of reading going on. Not exactly high literature, but it's a nice down-to-earth relationship to analyze (as a side note, the recipes in the book are nothing special. Too bad.). The spread is from the point of view of Valerie.

**Overview:** both main characters got a major arcana, which I find quite appropriate. Some reverses in the actions to take indicate that the path to reconciliation will not be easy.

**Interpretation:**

* The Judgment: the querent \
Valerie seems to have been the one that felt like it was in her right to judge all along, but at the same time she is also the one who decided to reach out to Lilly.

* The Devil reversed: the friend \
Lilly is seen as the sinner, the one following her senses and passions blindly. But the reverse card could mean that this period might be over and she has now taken a more balanced approach to her life.

* 7 of Swords: current status of the relationship \
The two girls are not trusting each other at all, each one feels like she has been robbed and cheated by the other

* Queen of Coins reversed: shared interests and goals \
Both girls want to be recognized as what (they think) they are and for their worth. However, they are afraid of taking the first step towards the other as to initiate the process.

* 8 of Wands reversed: how to strengthen the relationship \
Getting the relationship back on track will require a hard and painful conversation, almost more than what they can bear. If they can survive that, they will be on a good position to start rebuilding.

**Shadow card:** 4 of Coins \
A card of holding on... the girls have worked hard to be where they are now, to earn their current life. It's understandable that they don't want to risk losing it by reopening old wounds.
